Yao', e'In this paper we propose some new measures of language development using
network analyses, which is inspired by the recent surge of interests in network
studies of many real-world systems. Children\'s and care-takers\' speech data
from a longitudinal study are represented as a series of networks, word forms
being taken as nodes and collocation of words as links. Measures on the
properties of the networks, such as size, connectivity, hub and authority
analyses, etc., allow us to make quantitative comparison so as to reveal
different paths of development. For example, the asynchrony of development in
network size and average degree suggests that children cannot be simply
classified as early talkers or late talkers by one or two measures. Children
follow different paths in a multi-dimensional space. They may develop faster in
one dimension but slower in another dimension. The network approach requires
little preprocessing of words and analyses on sentence structures, and the
characteristics of words and their usage emerge from the network and are
independent of any grammatical presumptions. We show that the change of the two
articles "the" and "a" in their roles as important nodes in the network
reflects the progress of children\'s syntactic development: the two articles
often start in children\'s networks as hubs and later shift to authorities,
while they are authorities constantly in the adult\'s networks. The network
analyses provide a new approach to study language development, and at the same
time language development also presents a rich area for network theories to
explore.', '22 pages, 12 figures', null, null, 'cs.CL', 'cs.CL', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0601005v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0601005v1', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0601005v1');

But life deals with complexity every moment, without the chaos that engineers
fear so, by invoking goal-directed behaviour. Goals can be programmed. That is
why living organisms give us hope to achieve adaptability in robots. In this
paper a method for the description of a goal-directed, or programmed,
behaviour, interacting with uncertainty of environment, is described. We
suggest reducing the structural (goals, intentions) and stochastic components
(probability to realise the goal) of individual behaviour to random variables
with nominal values to apply probabilistic approach. This allowed us to use a
Normalized Entropy Index to detect the system state by estimating the
contribution of each agent to the group behaviour. The number of possible group
states is 27. We argue that adaptation has a limited number of possible paths
between these 27 states. Paths and states can be programmed so that after
adjustment to any particular case of task and conditions, adaptability will
never involve chaos. We suggest the application of the model to operation of
robots or other devices in remote and/or dangerous places.', e'Journal web page & a lot of robotic related papers

controller utilizes a gear box which comprises of epicyclic gear train with two
inputs, one coupled with the engine shaft and another with the shaft of a

speeds and is governed by the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train.
This new approach eliminates the use of a torque converter which is otherwise
an indispensable part of all available automatic transmissions, thereby
reducing the power loss that occurs in the box during the fluid coupling. By
gradually varying the speed of the dc motor a stepless transmission has been
achieved. The other advantages of the developed controller are pulling over and
reversing the vehicle, implemented by intelligent mixing of the dc motor and
engine speeds. This approach eliminates traditional braking system in entire
vehicle design. The use of two power sources, IC engine and battery driven DC

Hayes', e'The multi-armed bandit is a concise model for the problem of iterated
decision-making under uncertainty. In each round, a gambler must pull one of
$K$ arms of a slot machine, without any foreknowledge of their payouts, except
that they are uniformly bounded. A standard objective is to minimize the
gambler\'s regret, defined as the gambler\'s total payout minus the largest
payout which would have been achieved by any fixed arm, in hindsight. Note that
the gambler is only told the payout for the arm actually chosen, not for the
unchosen arms.
  Almost all previous work on this problem assumed the payouts to be
non-adaptive, in the sense that the distribution of the payout of arm $j$ in
round $i$ is completely independent of the choices made by the gambler on
rounds $1, \\dots, i-1$. In the more general model of adaptive payouts, the
payouts in round $i$ may depend arbitrarily on the history of past choices made
by the algorithm.
  We present a new algorithm for this problem, and prove nearly optimal
guarantees for the regret against both non-adaptive and adaptive adversaries.
After $T$ rounds, our algorithm has regret $O(\\sqrt{T})$ with high probability
(the tail probability decays exponentially). This dependence on $T$ is best
possible, and matches that of the full-information version of the problem, in
which the gambler is told the payouts for all $K$ arms after each round.
  Previously, even for non-adaptive payouts, the best high-probability bounds
known were $O(T^{2/3})$, due to Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, Freund and Schapire. The
expected regret of their algorithm is $O(T^{1/2}) for non-adaptive payouts, but

Arkin,Michael A. Bender,Joseph S. B. Mitchell,Valentin Polishchuk', e'We introduce the snowblower problem (SBP), a new optimization problem that is
closely related to milling problems and to some material-handling problems. The
objective in the SBP is to compute a short tour for the snowblower to follow to
remove all the snow from a domain (driveway, sidewalk, etc.). When a snowblower
passes over each region along the tour, it displaces snow into a nearby region.
The constraint is that if the snow is piled too high, then the snowblower
cannot clear the pile.
  We give an algorithmic study of the SBP. We show that in general, the problem
is NP-complete, and we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for
removing snow under various assumptions about the operation of the snowblower.
Most commercially-available snowblowers allow the user to control the direction
in which the snow is thrown. We differentiate between the cases in which the
snow can be thrown in any direction, in any direction except backwards, and
only to the right. For all cases, we give constant-factor approximation
algorithms; the constants increase as the throw direction becomes more
restricted.
  Our results are also applicable to robotic vacuuming (or lawnmowing) with
bounded capacity dust bin and to some versions of material-handling problems,
in which the goal is to rearrange cartons on the floor of a warehouse.', '19 pages, 10 figures, 1 table. Submitted to WAFR 2006', null, null, 'cs.DS', 'cs.DS,cs.CC,cs.RO,F.2.2; I.3.5', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0603026v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0603026v1', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0603026v1');

guaranteed in spite of possible errors in the detection of edges. When this

sources has become available, which offer information on various subjects by
different providers, often in heterogeneous formats. This calls for tools and
methods for building an advanced information-processing infrastructure. One
issue in this area is the selection of suitable information sources in query
answering. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this
problem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources
(prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user
query. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of
the information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a
formal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as
well). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a
query description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection
programs, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured
nature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must
carefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and
furthermore combine it with possible user preferences. A prototype
implementation of our approach has been realized exploiting the DLV KR system
and its plp front-end for prioritized ELPs. We describe a representative

operating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their
behavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in
order to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms
for task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication
between robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a
lack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult
to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic
task allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between
two types of task, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the
absence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the
state of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task
to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as
stochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior.
Specifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the
choice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The
mathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The

programs with aggregates. These definitions build on the notion of unfolding of
aggregates, and they are aimed at creating methodologies to translate logic
programs with aggregates to normal logic programs or positive programs, whose
answer set semantics can be used to defined the semantics of the original
programs. The first definition provides an alternative view of the semantics
for logic programming with aggregates described by Pelov et al.
  The second definition is similar to the traditional answer set definition for
normal logic programs, in that, given a logic program with aggregates and an
interpretation, the unfolding process produces a positive program. The paper
shows how this definition can be extended to consider aggregates in the head of
the rules.
  The proposed views of logic programming with aggregates are simple and
coincide with the ultimate stable model semantics, and with other semantic
characterizations for large classes of program (e.g., programs with monotone
aggregates and programs that are aggregate-stratified).
  Moreover, it can be directly employed to support an implementation using
available answer set solvers. The paper describes a system, called ASP^A, that
is capable of computing answer sets of programs with arbitrary (e.g.,
recursively defined) aggregates.', null, null, null, 'cs.SE', 'cs.SE,cs.AI', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605038v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0605038v1', 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0605038v1');

efficient representation of probability distributions is central in term of
computational efficiency in the field of probabilistic reasoning. The main
problem arises when dealing with joint probability distributions over a set of
random variables: they are always represented using huge probability arrays. In
this paper, a new method based on binary-tree representation is introduced in
order to store efficiently very large joint distributions. Our approach
approximates any multidimensional joint distributions using an adaptive
discretization of the space. We make the assumption that the lower is the
probability mass of a particular region of feature space, the larger is the
discretization step. This assumption leads to a very optimized representation
in term of time and memory. The other advantages of our approach are the
ability to refine dynamically the distribution every time it is needed leading
to a more accurate representation of the probability distribution and to an
anytime representation of the distribution.', null, e'International Conference on Tools for Artificial Intelligence -
