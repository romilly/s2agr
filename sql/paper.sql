The Kenyon cells of the Drosophila adult mushroom body (MB) respond sparsely to complex olfactory input, a property that is thought to support stimuli discrimination in the MB. To understand how this property emerges, we investigated the role of the inhibitory anterior paired lateral neuron (APL) in the input circuit of the MB, the calyx. Within the calyx, presynaptic boutons of projection neurons (PNs) form large synaptic microglomeruli (MGs) with dendrites of postsynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs). Combining EM data analysis and in vivo calcium imaging, we show that APL, via inhibitory and reciprocal synapses targeting both PN boutons and KC dendrites, normalizes odour-evoked representations in MGs of the calyx. APL response scales with the PN input strength and is regionalized around PN input distribution. Our data indicate that the formation of a sparse code by the Kenyon cells requires APL-driven normalization of their MG postsynaptic responses.

Computations for motor control must be performed quickly to correct errors in real time and should be sensitive to small differences between patterns for fine error correction while being resilient to noise7. Influential theories of cerebellar information processing have largely assumed random network connectivity, which increases the encoding capacity of the network’s first layer8–13. However, maximizing encoding capacity reduces resiliency to noise7. To understand how neuronal circuits address this fundamental tradeoff, we mapped the feedforward connectivity in the mouse cerebellar cortex using automated large-scale transmission electron microscopy (EM) and convolutional neural network-based image segmentation. We found that both the input and output layers of the circuit exhibit redundant and selective connectivity motifs, which contrast with prevailing models. Numerical simulations suggest these redundant, non-random connectivity motifs increase discriminability of similar input patterns at a minimal cost to the network’s overall encoding capacity. This work reveals how neuronal network structure can balance encoding capacity and redundancy, unveiling principles of biological network architecture with implications for artificial neural network design.", "citations": [{"title": "Automated Synapse Detection Method for Cerebellar Connectomics", "paperId": "4840bf9e2efc4ced1eb5151864853f5a909d4de3"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.11.29.470455", "CorpusId": 244802223}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 1, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/11/30/2021.11.29.470455.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Nguyen2021StructuredCI,\n author = {Tri M Nguyen and Logan A.

However, the neurochemical structure of crustacean olfactory glomeruli is largely understudied when compared to the insects. We analyzed the glomerular architecture in selected species of hermit crabs using immunohistochemistry against presynaptic proteins, the neuropeptides orcokinin, RFamide and allatostatin, and the biogenic amine serotonin. Our study reveals an unexpected level of structural complexity, unmatched by what is found in the insect olfactory glomeruli. Peptidergic and aminergic interneurons provide the structural basis for a regionalization of the crustacean glomeruli into longitudinal and concentric compartments. Our data suggest that local olfactory interneurons take a central computational role in modulating the information transfer from olfactory sensory neurons to projection neurons within the glomeruli. Furthermore, we found yet unknown neuronal elements mediating lateral inhibitory interactions across the glomerular array that may play a central role in modulating the transfer of sensory input to the output neurons through presynaptic inhibition.

Proofreading of whole-brain automated reconstructions will require many person-years of effort, due to the huge volumes of data involved. Here we present FlyWire, an online community for proofreading neural circuits in a Drosophila melanogaster brain and explain how its computational and social structures are organized to scale up to whole-brain connectomics. Browser-based three-dimensional interactive segmentation by collaborative editing of a spatially chunked supervoxel graph makes it possible to distribute proofreading to individuals located virtually anywhere in the world. Information in the edit history is programmatically accessible for a variety of uses such as estimating proofreading accuracy or building incentive systems. An open community accelerates proofreading by recruiting more participants and accelerates scientific discovery by requiring information sharing. We demonstrate how FlyWire enables circuit analysis by reconstructing and analyzing the connectome of mechanosensory neurons. FlyWire is an online community and a platform for proofreading electron microscopy-based connectome data of the Drosophila brain.", "citations": [{"title": "Virtual Fly Brain—An interactive atlas of

Here, we focus on changes in the behavioral state of Drosophila females that persist for minutes following optogenetic activation of a single class of central brain neurons termed pC1. We find that female pC1 neurons drive a variety of persistent behaviors in the presence of males, including increased receptivity, shoving, and chasing. By reconstructing cells in a volume electron microscopic image of the female brain, we classify 7 different pC1 cell types and, using cell type specific driver lines, determine that one of these, pC1-Alpha, is responsible for driving persistent female shoving and chasing. Using calcium imaging, we locate sites of minutes-long persistent neural activity in the brain, which include pC1 neurons themselves. Finally, we exhaustively reconstruct all synaptic partners of a single pC1-Alpha neuron, and find recurrent connectivity that could support the persistent neural activity. Our work thus links minutes-long persistent changes in behavior with persistent neural activity and recurrent circuit architecture in the female brain.", "citations": [{"title": "Modulation and Neural Correlates of Postmating Sleep Plasticity in Drosophila Females", "paperId": "49fccc03f04ed963948f64c4cf76459163a2f299"}, {"title": "Flexibility of neural circuits regulating mating behaviors in mice and flies", "paperId": "459debf1e78a0990b2ca27c70080d0ddb7fc6bf9"}, {"title": "Connectomics and the neural basis of behaviour", "paperId": "e67ce2076b1edb61228f9401bda7a0ea81f3055a"}, {"title": "Neural Control of Action Selection Among Innate Behaviors", "paperId": "219077e2b7c483024ac9c87a90cd7f0b6ffdbb1e"}, {"title": "The emergence and influence of internal states", "paperId": "8c2368c105302d57c078cdf44559058f60fc475a"}, {"title": "The Neuromodulatory Basis of Aggression: Lessons From the Humble Fruit Fly", "paperId": "c189e808578b1d2757ba001011afd8c9f226fd50"}, {"title": "Context-dependent control of behavior in Drosophila", "paperId": "cef850f3a71115204f91b715f656e4a293842a2e"}, {"title": "Neural mechanisms underlying the temporal organization of naturalistic animal behavior", "paperId": "69c41c8d0690297bbfb585d598b91a9ca2b3b9dd"}, {"title": "RealNeuralNetworks.jl: An Integrated Julia Package for Skeletonization, Morphological Analysis, and Synaptic Connectivity Analysis of Terabyte-Scale 3D Neural Segmentations", "paperId": "574fe91260f796820916c763948b7b684295fff0"}, {"title": "A dynamical systems view of neuroethology: Uncovering stateful computation in natural behaviors", "paperId": "01fdf11285bfe021eccc0a9926fa4ff3bea2fe34"}, {"title": "Mate Competition Drives Aggressive Behaviour in Female Drosophila", "paperId": "f59e8085154ed9002550440b0d1c11d9d37d06cd"}, {"title": "Make war not love: The neural substrate underlying a state-dependent switch in female social behavior", "paperId": "60120c8f8dbd24cda83f221c1efbe5536ec4ad9d"}, {"title": "Neural network organization for courtship-song feature detection in Drosophila", "paperId": "eaa1ad1f740fee4a03079af7764f8807bff9b6bf"}, {"title": "Neural Circuits Underlying Behavioral Flexibility: Insights From Drosophila", "paperId": "fd550e84503f474c952f1a52f66e85c314e49f54"}, {"title": "Flexible Circuit Mechanisms for Context-Dependent Song Sequencing", "paperId": "302b2d0cd0052892065975e91f0f0b2000de77d9"}, {"title": "Sexual Dimorphism in Aggression: Sex-Specific Fighting Strategies Across Species", "paperId": "48e1845fd3f7d02c8f3c551d2320451341c279d2"}, {"title": "Decisions in an Innate Behavioral Sequence", "paperId": "a6839621c1a1213502591b5e3cf2a635435b6a72"}, {"title": "Sex-specific speed–accuracy trade-offs shape neural processing of acoustic signals in a grasshopper", "paperId": "689649df60f3179847c2b8a92638febadc69a822"}, {"title": "A circuit logic for sexually shared and dimorphic aggressive behaviors in Drosophila\n", "paperId": "aff008c607c8106ebbf548e2f55cafb1022b5b0f"}, {"title": "A connectome of the Drosophila central complex reveals network motifs suitable for flexible navigation and context-dependent action selection", "paperId": "563dd34de81e2c2157b071fbd617642a9a831eed"}, {"title": "Inhibitory stabilization and cortical computation", "paperId": "64612c89a506ebb1c6ad44afbdb589da3fe8ce44"}, {"title": "Cell types and neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in Drosophila", "paperId": "df1696050c10fffb86668e9443d39cf72fbddf88"}, {"title": "FlyWire: Online community for whole-brain connectomics", "paperId": "3149671f907078eac6835a05a99da756c493a15b"}, {"title": "Sex-specific speed-accuracy tradeoffs shape neural processing of acoustic signals", "paperId": "3c01fef33280b903a04c1704010b837505151ccd"}, {"title": "A framework for studying behavioral evolution by reconstructing ancestral repertoires", "paperId": "67f557d5364ee6b358b63c6395f2c153bf9d9397"}, {"title": "Neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in Drosophila", "paperId": "f18ac21f76fa6b5b89fb45900bc7386ad7e8ceaa"}, {"title": "Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and target preference via sexually dimorphic neurons", "paperId": "3a4e5340f8ad346b518713851dffac0af9716d96"}, {"title": "Layered roles of fruitless isoforms in specification and function of male aggression-promoting neurons in Drosophila", "paperId": "12aea0814377dbd65f261734d7aa81be907cd181"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.7554/eLife.59502", "MAG": "3110215284", "PubMed": "33225998", "CorpusId": 213335916, "PubMedCentral": "7787663"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 28, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Deutsch2020TheNB,\n author = {David S Deutsch and Diego A.

Massive efforts have been dedicated to deciphering how experience affects behavior, and how different physiological and sensory phenomena modulate memory. Our ability to encode, consolidate and retrieve memories depends on internal drives, and sleep stands out among the physiological processes that affect memory: one of the most relatable benefits of sleep is the aiding of memory that occurs in order to both prepare the brain to learn new information, and after a learning task, to consolidate those new memories. Drosophila lends itself to the study of the interactions between memory and sleep. The fruit fly provides incomparable genetic resources, a mapped connectome, and an existing framework of knowledge on the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of memory and sleep, making the fruit fly a remarkable model to decipher the sophisticated regulation of learning and memory by the quantity and quality of sleep. Research in Drosophila has stablished not only that sleep facilitates learning in wild-type and memory-impaired animals, but that sleep deprivation interferes with the acquisition of new memories. In addition, it is well-accepted that sleep is paramount in memory consolidation processes. Finally, studies in Drosophila have shown that that learning itself can promote sleep drive. Nevertheless, the molecular and network mechanisms underlying this intertwined relationship are still evasive. Recent remarkable work has shed light on the neural substrates that mediate sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In a similar way, the mechanistic insights of the neural switch control between sleep-dependent and sleep-independent consolidation strategies were recently described. This review will discuss the regulation of memory by sleep in Drosophila, focusing on the most recent advances in the field and pointing out questions awaiting to be investigated.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fphys.2023.1087025", "CorpusId": 256001186}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2023.1087025/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'']{Marquand2023SleepBD,\n author = {Katherine Marquand and Camilla Roselli and Isaac Cervantes-Sandoval and Tamara Boto},\n booktitle = {Frontiers in Physiology},\n title = {Sleep benefits different stages of memory in Drosophila},\n volume = {14},\n year = {2023}\n}\n"}, "referenceCount": 165, "publicationDate": "2023-01-19", "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Biology"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Psychology"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationVenue": {"id": "e28a224b-8ddb-49a6-82d2-17f23c68b30c", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology", "issn": "1664-042X", "name": "Frontiers in Physiology", "type": "journal", "alternate_urls": ["http://www.frontiersin.org/physiology/about", "http://frontiersin.org/physiology"], "alternate_names": ["Front Physiol"]}, "influentialCitationCount": 0}', '2023-01-27 10:47:24.854114', '2023-01-27 10:47:24.854114', 'Sleep benefits different stages of memory in Drosophila', 2023, false, null, null, null, null);

While the technologies for neuronal reconstruction of EM images are under rapid progress, the technologies for synapse detection are lagging behind. Here, we propose a method that automatically detects the synapses in the 3D EM images, specifically for the mouse cerebellar molecular layer (CML). The method aims to accurately detect the synapses between the reconstructed neuronal fragments whose types can be identified. It extracts the contacts between the reconstructed neuronal fragments and classifies them as synaptic or non-synaptic with the help of type information and two deep learning artificial intelligences (AIs). The method can also assign the pre- and postsynaptic sides of a synapse and determine excitatory and inhibitory synapse types. The accuracy of this method is estimated to be 0.955 in F1-score for a test volume of CML containing 508 synapses. To demonstrate the usability, we measured the size and number of the synapses in the volume and investigated the subcellular connectivity between the CML neuronal fragments.

Using a new genetic knock-in strategy, we targeted the four co-receptors representing the chemosensory modes in Drosophila (Orco, Ir25a, Ir8a, Ir76b). Co-receptor knock-in expression patterns were verified as accurate representations of endogenous expression. We find extensive overlap in expression among the different co-receptors. As defined by innervation into antennal lobe glomeruli, Ir25a is broadly expressed in 88% of olfactory neuron classes and is co-expressed in 64% of Orco+ neuron classes, including all neuron classes in the maxillary palp. Orco, Ir8a, and Ir76b expression patterns are also expanded. Single sensillum recordings from Orco-expressing Ir25a mutant antennal and palpal neurons identify significant changes in olfactory responses.

Visual responses of a subset of pyramidal cells are included. The data are being made publicly available, along with tools for programmatic and 3D interactive access. The density of synaptic inputs onto inhibitory neurons varies across cell classes and compartments. We uncover a compartment-specific correlation between mitochondrial coverage and synapse density. Frequencies of connectivity motifs in the graph of pyramidal cells are predicted quite accurately from node degrees using the configuration model of random graphs. Cells receiving more connections from nearby cells exhibit stronger and more reliable visual responses. These example findings illustrate the resource’s utility for relating structure and function of cortical circuits as well as for neuronal cell biology.", "citations": [{"title": "Investigating Echo

To determine the underlying computational principles, we build a realistic computational model of a central decision module within the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), the fly’s center for learning and memory. Our model combines the electron microscopy-based architecture of one MB output neuron (MBON-α3), the synaptic connectivity of its 948 presynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs), and its membrane properties obtained from patch-clamp recordings. We show that this neuron is electrotonically compact and that synaptic input corresponding to simulated odor input robustly drives its spiking behavior. Therefore, sparse innervation by KCs can efficiently control and modulate MBON activity in response to learning with minimal requirements on the specificity of synaptic localization. This architecture allows efficient storage of large numbers of memories using the flexible stochastic connectivity of the circuit.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2020.12.06.413500", "CorpusId": 247085404}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/03/04/2020.12.06.413500.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Hafez2022TheCA,\n author = {Omar A.

A fundamental problem is that training data is always ﬁnite, making it unclear how to generalise to unseen data. But, animals do react appropriately to unseen data, wielding Occam’s razor to select a parsimo-nious explanation of the observations. How they do this is called their inductive bias, and it is implicitly built into the operation of animals’ neural circuits. This relationship between an observed circuit and its inductive bias is a useful explanatory window for neuroscience, allowing design choices to be understood normatively. However, it is generally very difﬁcult to map circuit structure to inductive bias. In this work we present a neural network tool to bridge this gap. The tool allows us to meta-learn the inductive bias of neural circuits by learning functions that a neural circuit ﬁnds easy to generalise, since easy-to-generalise functions are exactly those the circuit chooses to explain incomplete data. We show that in systems where the inductive bias is known analytically, i.e. linear and kernel regression, our tool recovers it. Then, we show it is able to ﬂexibly extract inductive biases from differentiable circuits, including spiking neural networks, and use it to interpret recent connectomic data through their effect on generalisation. This illustrates the intended use of our tool: understanding the role of otherwise opaque pieces of neural functionality through the inductive bias they induce.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "2211.13544", "CorpusId": 254018268}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Dorrell2022Meta-LearningTI,\n author = {W.

Volumetric nanometer-resolution imaging of brain tissue provides the raw data needed to build such maps, but inferring all the relevant cellular and subcellular annotation layers is challenging. Here, we present Segmentation-Guided Contrastive Learning of Representations (“SegCLR”), a self-supervised machine learning technique that produces highly informative representations of cells directly from 3d electron microscope imagery and segmentations. When applied to volumes of human and mouse cerebral cortex, SegCLR enabled the classification of cellular subcompartments (axon, dendrite, soma, astrocytic process) with 4,000-fold less labeled data compared to fully supervised approaches. Surprisingly, SegCLR also enabled inference of cell types (neurons, glia, and subtypes of each) from fragments with lengths as small as 10 micrometers, a task that can be difficult for humans to perform and whose feasibility greatly enhances the utility of imaging portions of brains in which many neuron fragments terminate at a volume boundary. These predictions were further augmented via Gaussian process uncertainty estimation to enable analyses restricted to high confidence subsets of the data. Finally, SegCLR enabled detailed exploration of layer-5 pyramidal cell subtypes and automated large-scale statistical analysis of upstream and downstream synaptic partners in mouse visual cortex.", "citations": [{"title": "Synthetic data enable experiments in atomistic machine learning", "paperId": "f64d3a093cbb4b1211527719478627590b959f71"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.03.29.486320", "CorpusId": 247857249}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 2, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/03/30/2022.03.29.486320.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Dorkenwald2022Multi-LayeredMO,\n author = {Sven Dorkenwald and Peter H.

About 150 uPNs constituting 58 glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL) are bundled together in the axonal extension, routing the olfactory signal received at AL to mushroom body (MB) calyx and lateral horn (LH). Here we quantify the neuronal organization by inter-PN distances and examine its relationship with the odor types sensed by Drosophila. The homotypic uPNs that constitute glomeruli are tightly bundled and stereotyped in position throughout the neuropils, even though the glomerular PN organization in AL is no longer sustained in the higher brain center. Instead, odor-type dependent clusters consisting of multiple homotypes innervate the MB calyx and LH. Pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes are spatially segregated in MB calyx, whereas two distinct clusters of food-related homotypes are found in LH in addition to the segregation of pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes. We find that there are statistically significant associations between the spatial organization among a group of homotypic uPNs and certain stereotyped olfactory responses. Additionally, the signals from some of the tightly bundled homotypes converge to a specific group of lateral horn neurons (LHNs), which indicates that homotype (or odor type) specific integration of signals occurs at the synaptic interface between PNs and LHNs. Our findings suggest that before neural computation in the inner brain, some of the olfactory information are already encoded in the spatial organization of uPNs, illuminating that a certain degree of labeled-line strategy is at work in the Drosophila olfactory system.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.02.23.481655", "PubMed": "36173095", "CorpusId": 247159820, "PubMedCentral": "9616568"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Choi2022OlfactoryRO,\n author = {Kiri Choi and Won Kyu Kim and Changbong Hyeon},\n booktitle = {bioRxiv},\n journal = {eLife},\n title = {Olfactory responses of Drosophila are encoded in the organization of projection neurons},\n volume = {11},\n year = {2022}\n}\n"}, "referenceCount": 92, "publicationDate": "2022-07-31", "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"source": "external", "category": "Medicine"}, {"source": "external", "category": "Biology"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Biology"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationVenue": {"id": "027ffd21-ebb0-4af8-baf5-911124292fd0", "url": "http://biorxiv.org/", "name": "bioRxiv", "type": "journal"}, "influentialCitationCount": 0}', '2023-01-27 10:46:14.748432', '2023-01-27 10:46:14.748432', 'Olfactory responses of Drosophila are encoded in the organization of projection neurons', 2022, false, null, null, null, null);

In Drosophila melanogaster, the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body integrate inputs from a random set of olfactory projection neurons, but some projection neurons — namely those activated by a few ethologically meaningful odors — connect to Kenyon cells more frequently than others. This biased and random connectivity pattern is conceivably advantageous, as it enables the mushroom body to represent a large number of odors as unique activity patterns while prioritizing the representation of a few specific odors. How this connectivity pattern is established remains largely unknown. Here, we test whether the mechanisms patterning the connections between Kenyon cells and projection neurons depend on sensory activity or whether they are hardwired. We mapped a large number of mushroom body input connections in anosmic flies — flies lacking the obligate odorant co-receptor Orco — and in wildtype flies. Statistical analyses of these datasets reveal that the random and biased connectivity pattern observed between Kenyon cells and projection neurons forms normally in the absence of most olfactory sensory activity. This finding supports the idea that even comparatively subtle, population-level patterns of neuronal connectivity can be encoded by fixed genetic programs and are likely to be the result of evolved prioritization of ecologically and ethologically salient stimuli.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.11.06.467552", "PubMed": "35977547", "CorpusId": 243865078}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/11/07/2021.11.06.467552.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Hayashi2021MushroomBI,\n author = {T.

These studies have inspired computational models of circuit function that rely on random connectivity26–33. It remains, nonetheless, unclear whether the olfactory connectivity contains spatial structure. Here, we use high throughput anatomical methods (MAPseq and BARseq)34–38 to analyze the projections of 5,309 bulb and 30,433 piriform cortex output neurons in the mouse at single-cell resolution. We identify previously unrecognized spatial organization in connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis (A-P) of the piriform cortex. We find that both the bulb projections to the cortex and the cortical outputs are not random, but rather form gradients along the A-P axis. Strikingly, these gradients are matched: bulb neurons targeting a given location within the piriform cortex co-innervate extra-piriform regions that receive strong inputs from neurons within that piriform locus. We also identify signatures of local connectivity in the piriform cortex. Our findings suggest an organizing principle of matched direct and indirect olfactory pathways that innervate extra-piriform targets in a coordinated manner, thus supporting models of information processing that rely on structured connectivity within the olfactory system.", "citations": [{"title": "Molecular characterization of projection neuron subtypes in the mouse olfactory bulb", "paperId": "a8b3f13957c71a6e95196a643a524561eb98735f"}, {"title": "Molecular characterization of projection neuron subtypes in the 1 mouse olfactory bulb 2 3 4 5", "paperId": "84f2865e42a3837996549c9894e21dda17020755"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.05.12.443929", "CorpusId": 234752650}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 2, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/05/14/2021.05.12.443929.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Chen2021WiringLO,\n author = {Yushu Chen and Xiaoyin Chen and Batuhan Baserdem and Huiqing Zhan and Yan Li and Martin B.

However, the birth timing of individual GrCs dictates where their axons project. Using viral-genetic techniques, we find that early- and late-born GrCs receive different proportions of inputs from the same set of input regions. In vivo multidepth two-photon Ca2+ imaging of axons of early- and late-born GrCs reveals that both populations represent diverse task variables and stimuli, with small differences in the proportions of axons in encoding of a subset of movement and reward parameters. These results indicate that birth timing makes a modest contribution to the input selection and physiological response properties of GrCs. Cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) are usually regarded as a uniform cell type that collectively expands the coding space of the cerebellum by integrating diverse combinations of mossy fiber inputs. Accordingly, stable molecularly or physiologically defined GrC subtypes within a single cerebellar region have not been reported. The only known cellular property that distinguishes otherwise homogeneous GrCs is the correspondence between GrC birth timing and the depth of the molecular layer to which their axons project. To determine the role birth timing plays in GrC wiring and function, we developed genetic strategies to access early- and late-born GrCs. We initiated retrograde monosynaptic rabies virus tracing from control (birth timing unrestricted), early-born, and late-born GrCs, revealing the different patterns of mossy fiber input to GrCs in vermis lobule 6 and simplex, as well as to early- and late-born GrCs of vermis lobule 6: sensory and motor nuclei provide more input to early-born GrCs, while basal pontine and cerebellar nuclei provide more input to late-born GrCs. In vivo multidepth two-photon Ca2+ imaging of axons of early- and late-born GrCs revealed representations of diverse task variables and stimuli by both populations, with modest differences in the proportions encoding movement, reward anticipation, and reward consumption. Our results suggest neither organized parallel processing nor completely random organization of mossy fiber→GrC circuitry but instead a moderate influence of birth timing on GrC wiring and encoding. Our imaging data also provide evidence that GrCs can represent generalized responses to aversive stimuli, in addition to recently described reward representations.", "citations": [{"title": "Cerebellum lineage allocation, morphogenesis and repair: impact of interplay amongst cells.", "paperId": "3b86f55306a056ba1c1d06aeab0c9c3925f5eaa2"}, {"title": "Times of neuron origin and neurogenetic gradients in mice Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons during the development of the cerebellum.

How the specific structural features of these networks give rise to their learning function remains largely unknown. To investigate this structure–function relationship, we developed a minimal computational model of the extensively studied Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body. We show how well-defined connectivity patterns between the Kenyon cells — the constituent neurons of the mushroom body — and their input projection neurons endow different functions, enabling the mushroom body to process olfactory information more efficiently. First, biases in the likelihoods at which individual projection neurons connect to Kenyon cells allow the mushroom body to prioritize the learning of particular, ethologically meaningful odors. Second, groups of projection neurons connecting preferentially to the same Kenyon cells facilitate the mushroom body to generalize across similar odors. Altogether, our results demonstrate how different connectivity patterns shape the representation space of a well-studied cerebellum-like network and impact its learning outcomes.", "citations": [{"title": "Meta-Learning the Inductive Biases of Simple Neural Circuits", "paperId": "b60e981fd5268a290dbf4e7d8346036396ecaf7d"}, {"title": "Mushroom body input connections form independently of sensory activity in Drosophila melanogaster\n", "paperId": "1cd72757ee075e80c3cab9b0fbe2db732616b474"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.02.10.430647", "CorpusId": 237209465}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 2, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/08/16/2021.02.10.430647.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Zavitz2021ConnectivityPT,\n author = {D.

How might neurons behave similarly despite having different underlying features? We addressed these questions in neurons called Kenyon cells, which store olfactory memories in flies. Kenyon cells differ among themselves in key features that affect how active they are, and in a model of the fly’s memory circuit, adding this interneuronal variability made the model fly worse at learning the values of multiple odors. However, memory performance was rescued if compensation between the variable underlying features allowed Kenyon cells to be equally active on average, and we found the hypothesized compensatory variability in real Kenyon cells’ anatomy. This work reveals the existence and computational benefits of compensatory variability in neural networks. Neural circuits use homeostatic compensation to achieve consistent behavior despite variability in underlying intrinsic and network parameters. However, it remains unclear how compensation regulates variability across a population of the same type of neurons within an individual and what computational benefits might result from such compensation. We address these questions in the Drosophila mushroom body, the fly’s olfactory memory center. In a computational model, we show that under sparse coding conditions, memory performance is degraded when the mushroom body’s principal neurons, Kenyon cells (KCs), vary realistically in key parameters governing their excitability. However, memory performance is rescued while maintaining realistic variability if parameters compensate for each other to equalize KC average activity. Such compensation can be achieved through both activity-dependent and activity-independent mechanisms. Finally, we show that correlations predicted by our model’s compensatory mechanisms appear in the Drosophila hemibrain connectome. These findings reveal compensatory variability in the mushroom body and describe its computational benefits for associative memory.", "citations": [{"title": "The cellular architecture of memory modules in Drosophila supports stochastic input integration", "paperId": "bd04c9a4e66dbb8ad2217c6f7ddce1fad1157919"}, {"title": "Sketch of a novel approach to a neural model", "paperId": "1df4e7c89c2b1c89ec5f6a03cb430886ba77fe1c"}, {"title": "Central organization of a high-dimensional odor space", "paperId": "5e9de283947be7872688f88280edc2271c720e51"}, {"title": "Developing a Novel Place Preference Assay to Compare Drosophila Species Over Time", "paperId": null}, {"title": "Associative learning drives longitudinally graded presynaptic plasticity of neurotransmitter release along axonal compartments", "paperId": "629baf118640ff96974ca7304d9c45b45ac5dad3"}, {"title": "Forecast-based attribution of a winter heatwave within the limit of predictability", "paperId": "faf26098114b028e4125cc46d4d1fea6b2459d96"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1073/pnas.2102158118", "PubMed": "34845010", "CorpusId": 231885577, "PubMedCentral": "8670477"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 6, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Abdelrahman2021CompensatoryVI,\n author = {Nada Y.

At its core it consists of a population of Kenyon cells, which receive inputs from multiple sensory modalities. These cells are inhibited by the anterior paired lateral neuron, thus creating a sparse high dimensional representation of the inputs. In this work we study a mathematical formalization of this network motif and apply it to learning the correlational structure between words and their context in a corpus of unstructured text, a common natural language processing (NLP) task. We show that this network can learn semantic representations of words and can generate both static and context-dependent word embeddings. Unlike conventional methods (e.g., BERT, GloVe) that use dense representations for word embedding, our algorithm encodes semantic meaning of words and their context in the form of sparse binary hash codes. The quality of the learned representations is evaluated on word similarity analysis, word-sense disambiguation, and document classification. It is shown that not only can the fruit fly network motif achieve performance comparable to existing methods in NLP, but, additionally, it uses only a fraction of the computational resources (shorter training time and smaller memory footprint).", "citations": [{"title": "Language Cognition and Language Computation - Human and Machine Language Understanding", "paperId": "75549ee37396bdb71d73c31b6b2506b2416219e0"}, {"title": "Modeling the Evolution of Biological Neural Networks Based on Caenorhabditis elegans Connectomes across Development", "paperId": "738c8198b637049bae7010ab1c8684cd7c4db15c"}, {"title": "Hebbian Continual Representation Learning", "paperId": "047e2633dbc775c4ec16173078b8d42c28fa2faf"}, {"title": "Using Connectome Features to Constrain Echo State Networks", "paperId": "dd22dda4146046f940d8806359c0054ec76b267f"}, {"title": "Learning to modulate random weights can induce task-specific contexts for economical meta and continual learning", "paperId": "30c0218c2c53dc29a6ecb49ed08b2d5cf6da3dd5"}, {"title": "Federated Nearest Neighbor Classification with a Colony of Fruit-Flies: With Supplement", "paperId": "770144a0d32d5e66982d0cd7f6ec305de2af3b84"}, {"title": "Analogy-Guided Evolutionary Pretraining of Binary Word Embeddings", "paperId": "3e8a29d88f7227dba69ecd96424e41210ce6fdd2"}, {"title": "Learning Sparse Binary Code for Maximum Inner Product Search", "paperId": "88499bc8aaf92e9fa2d7d3ba5b0a1f20b3c07e0a"}, {"title": "Fine-Tuning Transformer-XL on Clinical Natural Language Processing", "paperId": "ae775979a3a94d9ce20256028eaf054fccf8dfa7"}], "externalIds": {"MAG": "3126057586", "DBLP": "conf/iclr/LiangRHGNZK21", "ArXiv": "2101.06887", "CorpusId": 231632900}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 9, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Mathematics"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Liang2021CanAF,\n author = {Yuchen Liang and Chaitanya K.

The mushroom body (MB) is well positioned for developing and testing such an approach due to its conserved neuronal architecture, recently completed dense connectome, and extensive prior experimental studies of its roles in learning, memory, and activity regulation. Here, we identify new components of the MB circuit in Drosophila, including extensive visual input and MB output neurons (MBONs) with direct connections to descending neurons. We find unexpected structure in sensory inputs, in the transfer of information about different sensory modalities to MBONs, and in the modulation of that transfer by dopaminergic neurons (DANs). We provide insights into the circuitry used to integrate MB outputs, connectivity between the MB and the central complex and inputs to DANs, including feedback from MBONs. Our results provide a foundation for further theoretical and experimental work.", "citations": [{"title": "Sleep benefits different stages of memory in Drosophila", "paperId":

The mushroom body (MB) is well positioned for developing and testing such an approach due to its conserved neuronal architecture, recently completed dense connectome, and extensive prior experimental studies of its roles in learning, memory and activity regulation. Here we identify new components of the MB circuit in Drosophila, including extensive visual input and MB output neurons (MBONs) with direct connections to descending neurons. We find unexpected structure in sensory inputs, in the transfer of information about different sensory modalities to MBONs, and in the modulation of that transfer by dopaminergic neurons (DANs). We provide insights into the circuitry used to integrate MB outputs, connectivity between the MB and the central complex and inputs to DANs, including feedback from MBONs. Our results provide a foundation for further theoretical and experimental work.", "citations": [{"title": "Informing generative replay for continual learning with long-term memory formation in the

To understand how these building blocks form whole circuits, we must distil these broad classes into neuronal cell types and describe their network connectivity. Using an electron micrograph dataset for an entire Drosophila melanogaster brain, we reconstruct the first complete inventory of olfactory projections connecting the antennal lobe, the insect analogue of the mammalian olfactory bulb, to higher-order brain regions in an adult animal brain. We then connect this inventory to extant data in the literature, providing synaptic-resolution ‘holotypes’ both for heavily investigated and previously unknown cell types. Projection neurons are approximately twice as numerous as reported by light level studies; cell types are stereotyped, but not identical, in cell and synapse numbers between brain hemispheres. The lateral horn, the insect analogue of the mammalian cortical amygdala, is the main target for this olfactory information and has been shown to guide innate behaviour. Here, we find new connectivity motifs, including: axo-axonic connectivity between projection neurons; feedback and lateral inhibition of these axons by local neurons; and the convergence of different inputs, including non-olfactory inputs and memory-related feedback onto lateral horn neurons. This differs from the configuration of the second most prominent target for olfactory projection neurons: the mushroom body calyx, the insect analogue of the mammalian piriform cortex and a centre for associative memory. Our work provides a complete neuroanatomical platform for future studies of the adult Drosophila olfactory system.

Serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) is among the most prolific imaging methods employed in pursuit of such reconstructions. We demonstrate how Flood-Filling Networks (FFNs) can be used to computationally segment a forty-teravoxel whole-brain Drosophila ssTEM volume. To compensate for data irregularities and imperfect global alignment, FFNs were combined with procedures that locally re-align serial sections as well as dynamically adjust and synthesize image content. The proposed approach produced a largely merger-free segmentation of the entire ssTEM Drosophila brain, which we make freely available. As compared to manual tracing using an efficient skeletonization strategy, the segmentation enabled circuit reconstruction and analysis workflows that were an order of magnitude faster.", "citations":

About 150 uPNs constituting 58 glomeruli in the antennal lobe 10 (AL) are bundled together in the axonal extension, routing the olfactory signal received at AL to 11 mushroom body (MB) calyx and lateral horn (LH). Here we quantify the neuronal organization in 12 terms of the inter-PN distances and examine its relationship with the odor types sensed by 13 Drosophila . The homotypic uPNs that constitute glomeruli are tightly bundled and stereotyped in 14 position throughout the neuropils, even though the glomerular PN organization in AL is no longer 15 sustained in the higher brain center. Instead, odor-type dependent clusters consisting of multiple 16 homotypes innervate the MB calyx and LH. Pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing 17 homotypes are spatially segregated in MB calyx, whereas two distinct clusters of food-related 18 homotypes are found in LH in addition to the segregation of pheromone-encoding and 19 hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes.

This expansion implies that odors could activate hundreds of glomeruli, which would pose challenges for higher order processing. To study this problem, we generated the first transgenic ants, expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon imaging, we mapped complete glomerular responses to four ant alarm pheromones. Alarm pheromones robustly activated ≤6 glomeruli, and activity maps for the three pheromones inducing panic-alarm in our study species converged on a single glomerulus. These results demonstrate that, rather than using broadly tuned combinatorial encoding, ants employ precise, narrowly tuned, and stereotyped representation of alarm pheromone cues. The identification of a central sensory hub glomerulus for alarm behavior suggests that a simple neural architecture is sufficient to translate pheromone perception into behavioral outputs.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.12.29.522224", "CorpusId": 255264956}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/12/29/2022.12.29.522224.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Hart2022SparseAS,\n author = {Taylor Hart and Dominic Frank and L.

Recent improvements in methodology are currently driving a revolution in volume EM, making possible the structural imaging of whole organs and small organisms. In turn, these recent developments in image acquisition have created or stressed bottlenecks in other parts of the pipeline, like sample preparation, image analysis and data management. While the progress in image analysis is stunning due to the advent of automatic segmentation and server‐based annotation tools, several challenges remain.

However, the sheer density of information in such datasets makes the development of unbiased, scalable machine learning techniques a necessity for extracting novel insights without extremely time-consuming, intensive labor. In this paper, we present SynapseCLR, a self-supervised contrastive representation learning method for 3D electron microscopy (EM) data, and use the method to extract feature representations of synapses from a 3D EM dataset from mouse visual cortex. We show that our representations separate synapses according to both their overall physical appearance and structural annotations of known functional importance. We further demonstrate the utility of our methodology for several valuable downstream tasks for the growing field of 3D EM connectomics. These include one-shot identification of defective synapse segmentations, dataset-wide similarity-based querying, and accurate imputation of annotations for unlabeled synapses, using only manual annotation of 0.2% of synapses in the dataset. In particular, we show that excitatory vs. inhibitory neuronal cell types can be assigned to individual synapses and highly truncated neurites with accuracy exceeding 99.8%, making this population accessible to connectomics analysis. Finally, we present a data-driven and unsupervised study of the manifold of synaptic structural variation, revealing its intrinsic axes of variation and showing that synapse structure is also strongly correlated with inhibitory neuronal subtypes.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.06.07.495207", "CorpusId": 249613201}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/06/09/2022.06.07.495207.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Wilson2022UncoveringFO,\n author = {A.

In Drosophila a dedicated olfactory channel senses a male pheromone, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) that promotes female courtship while repelling males. Here we show that flies use separate cVA processing streams to extract qualitative and positional information. cVA olfactory neurons are sensitive to concentration differences in a 5 mm range around a male. Second-order projection neurons detect inter-antennal differences in cVA concentration, encoding the angular position of a male. We identify a circuit mechanism increasing left-right contrast through an interneuron which provides contralateral inhibition. At the third layer of the circuit we identify neurons with distinct response properties and sensory integration motifs. One population is selectively tuned to an approaching male with speed-dependent responses. A second population responds tonically to a male’s presence and controls female mating decisions. A third population integrates a male taste cue with cVA; only a simultaneous presentation of both signals promotes female mating via this pathway. Thus the olfactory system generates a range of complex percepts in discrete populations of central neurons that allow the expression of appropriate behaviors depending on context. Such separation of olfactory features resembles the mammalian what and where visual streams. Highlights cVA male pheromone has a 5 mm signaling range, activating two parallel central pathways Pheromone-sensing neurons have spatial receptive fields sharpened by contralateral inhibition Position (where) and identity (what) are separated at the 3rd layer of cVA processing Integrating taste and cVA in sexually dimorphic aSP-g controls female receptivity", "citations": [{"title": "Drosophila olfaction: past, present and future", "paperId": "6c32d89c783891ba23860a8999e8150812c99b73"}, {"title": "Organization of the parallel antennal-lobe tracts in the moth", "paperId": "753a5e590839477f14fa4d2b952fc6bc6ecfbf88"}, {"title": "Connectomics and the neural basis of behaviour", "paperId": "e67ce2076b1edb61228f9401bda7a0ea81f3055a"}, {"title": "Selective integration of diverse taste inputs within a single taste modality", "paperId": "94dd8cebc9f2b465b2c2dfe123edc3c217b215f2"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.05.13.491877", "CorpusId": 248836017}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 7, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/06/09/2022.05.13.491877.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Taisz2022GeneratingPR,\n author = {István Taisz and E.

While performing such experiments, we found that low levels of leaky Chrimson expression can lead to strong artifactual GCaMP signals in presumptive postsynaptic neurons even when Chrimson is not intentionally expressed in any particular neurons. Withholding all-trans retinal, the chromophore required as a co-factor for Chrimson response to light, eliminates GCaMP signal but does not provide an experimental control for leaky Chrimson expression. Leaky Chrimson expression appears to be an inherent feature of current Chrimson transgenes, since artifactual connectivity was detected with Chrimson transgenes integrated into three different genomic locations (two insertions tested in larvae; a third insertion tested in the adult fly). These false-positive signals may complicate the interpretation of functional connectivity experiments. We illustrate how a no-Gal4 negative control improves interpretability of functional connectivity assays. We also propose a simple but effective procedure to identify experimental conditions that minimize potentially incorrect interpretations caused by leaky Chrimson expression.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.05.26.493610", "CorpusId": 249241868}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/05/28/2022.05.26.493610.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Tadres2022AnEE,\n author = {David Tadres and Hiroshi M.

Despite these powerful applications, there are still many tasks in our daily life that are rather simple to humans but pose great challenges to AI. These include image and language understanding, few-shot learning, abstract concepts, and low-energy cost computing. Thus, learning from the brain is still a promising way that can shed light on the development of next-generation AI. The brain is arguably the only known intelligent machine in the universe, which is the product of evolution for animals surviving in the natural environment. At the behavior level, psychology and cognitive sciences have demonstrated that human and animal brains can execute very intelligent high-level cognitive functions. At the structure level, cognitive and computational neurosciences have unveiled that the brain has extremely complicated but elegant network forms to support its functions. Over years, people are gathering knowledge about the structure and functions of the brain, and this process is accelerating recently along with the initiation of giant brain projects worldwide. Here, we argue that the general principles of brain functions are the most valuable things to inspire the development of AI. These general principles are the standard rules of the brain extracting, representing, manipulating, and retrieving information, and here we call them the first principles of the brain. This paper collects six such first principles. They are attractor network, criticality, random network, sparse coding, relational memory, and perceptual learning. On each topic, we review its biological background, fundamental property, potential application to AI, and future development.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "2301.08382", "CorpusId": 256080679}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'']{Chen2023AIOB,\n author = {Luyao Chen and Zhiqiang Chen and Longsheng Jiang and Xiang-Lan Liu and Linlu Xu and Bo Zhang and Xiaolong Zou and Jin-qiao Gao and Yu Zhu and Xizi Gong and S.

This context-dependent neuromodulation is largely based on non-synaptic signalling with neuropeptides. Here, we describe select peptidergic systems in the Drosophila brain that act at different levels of a hierarchy to modulate behaviour and associated physiology. These systems modulate circuits in brain regions, such as the central complex and the mushroom bodies, which supervise specific behaviours. At the top level of the hierarchy there are small numbers of large peptidergic neurons that arborize widely in multiple areas of the brain to orchestrate or modulate global activity in a state and context-dependent manner. At the bottom level local peptidergic neurons provide executive neuromodulation of sensory gain and intrinsically in restricted parts of specific neuronal circuits. The orchestrating neurons receive interoceptive signals that mediate energy and sleep homeostasis, metabolic state and circadian timing, as well as external cues that affect food search, aggression or mating. Some of these cues can be triggers of conflicting behaviours such as mating versus aggression, or sleep versus feeding, and peptidergic neurons participate in circuits, enabling behaviour choices and switches.", "citations": [{"title": "Selection and Comparative Gene Expression of Midgut-Specific Targets for Drosophila suzukii", "paperId": "6dd847dbf78800680564fc1172d55b5f1c27aeb4"}, {"title": "System-wide mapping of neuropeptide-GPCR interactions in C. elegans", "paperId": "61a58110c88cac658f9efa5d3397695f560efb91"}, {"title": "The incidence of candidate binding sites for β-arrestin in Drosophila neuropeptide GPCRs", "paperId": "ed8df20c560b5d55b46ce9fc5a9e9b12a36841c3"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1098/rsob.220174", "PubMed": "35892199", "CorpusId": 251071320, "PubMedCentral": "9326288"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 3, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'', ''JournalArticle'']{Nässel2022EndocrineCN,\n author = {D.

For understanding such interorgan communications through endocrine factors, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serves as an excellent model system due to conservation of essential endocrine systems between flies and mammals and availability of powerful genetic tools. In Drosophila and other insects, functions of neuropeptides or peptide hormones from the central nervous system have been extensively studied. However, a series of recent studies conducted in Drosophila revealed that peptide hormones derived from peripheral tissues also play critical roles in regulating multiple biological processes, including growth, metabolism, reproduction, and behaviour. Here, we summarise recent advances in understanding target organs/tissues and functions of peripherally derived peptide hormones in Drosophila and describe how these hormones contribute to various biological events through interorgan communications.", "citations": [{"title": "Insulin-like peptide 8 (Ilp8) regulates female fecundity in flies", "paperId": "19325dd95cb9faa25bf2a0bd5f11a82ef91e1557"}, {"title": "The multiple lncRNAs encoding hsrω gene is essential for oogenesis in Drosophila", "paperId": "de694ad100936e90e73a8d1d4a89a36b3557c3ff"}, {"title": "A gut-derived hormone suppresses sugar appetite and regulates food choice in Drosophila", "paperId": "bb0db0dbb81086cfe14115326de52d19937360c0"}, {"title": "The incidence of candidate binding sites for β-arrestin in Drosophila neuropeptide GPCRs", "paperId": "ed8df20c560b5d55b46ce9fc5a9e9b12a36841c3"}, {"title": "Endocrine cybernetics: neuropeptides as molecular switches in behavioural decisions", "paperId": "9088b5478fc706f368d2d1fd5661aba9384d782b"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1080/19336934.2022.2061834", "PubMed": "35499154", "CorpusId": 248494316, "PubMedCentral": "9067537"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 5, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'', ''JournalArticle'']{Okamoto2022InterorganCT,\n author = {Naoki Okamoto and Akira Watanabe},\n booktitle = {Fly},\n journal = {Fly},\n pages = {152 - 176},\n title = {Interorgan communication through peripherally derived peptide hormones in Drosophila},\n volume = {16},\n year = {2022}\n}\n"}, "referenceCount": 270, "publicationDate": "2022-05-01", "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"source": "external", "category": "Medicine"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Biology"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationVenue": {"id": "b532b8f2-0702-41c7-bc2e-150a98398c87", "url": "http://landesbioscience.com/journals/fly", "issn": "1933-6934", "name": "Fly", "type": "journal", "alternate_urls": ["http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/kfly20", "https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/kfly20/current", "http://rzblx1.uni-regensburg.de/ezeit/warpto.phtml?colors=7&jour_id=85222"]}, "influentialCitationCount": 0}', '2023-01-27 10:56:06.354589', '2023-01-27 10:56:06.354589', 'Interorgan communication through peripherally derived peptide hormones in Drosophila', 2022, false, null, null, null, null);

Users can search for neurons, neuroanatomy and reagents by name, location, or connectivity, via text search, clicking on 3D images, search-by-image, and queries by type (e.g., dopaminergic neuron) or properties (e.g., synaptic input in the antennal lobe).

In parallel in silico experiments, we show that artificial neural networks trained to distinguish self and world motion incorporate similar negative evidence.

Changes in locomotion in response to odors are an important mechanism by which animals access resources important to their survival. Odor-modulated changes in locomotion in insects constitute a whole suite of flexible behaviors that allow insects to close in on these resources from long distances and perform local searches to locate and subsequently assess them. Here, we review changes in odor-mediated locomotion across many insect species. We emphasize that changes in locomotion induced by odors are diverse.

The pattern of changes in the visual scene induced by self-motion is the optic flow1, which is first estimated in local patches by directionally selective (DS) neurons2–4. But how should the arrays of DS neurons, each responsive to motion in a preferred direction at a specific retinal position, be organized to support robust decoding of optic flow by downstream circuits? Understanding this global organization is challenging because it requires mapping fine, local features of neurons across the animal’s field of view3. In Drosophila, the asymmetric dendrites of the T4 and T5 DS neurons establish their preferred direction, making it possible to predict DS responses from anatomy4,5. Here we report that the preferred directions of fly DS neurons vary at different retinal positions and show that this spatial variation is established by the anatomy of the compound eye. To estimate the preferred directions across the visual field, we reconstructed hundreds of T4 neurons in a full brain EM volume6 and discovered unexpectedly stereotypical dendritic arborizations that are independent of location. We then used whole-head μCT scans to map the viewing directions of all compound eye facets and found a non-uniform sampling of visual space that explains the spatial variation in preferred directions. Our findings show that the organization of preferred directions in the fly is largely determined by the compound eye, exposing an intimate and unexpected connection between the peripheral structure of the eye, functional properties of neurons deep in the brain, and the control of body movements.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.12.14.520178", "CorpusId": 254736078}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/12/15/2022.12.14.520178.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Zhao2022EyeSS,\n author = {Arthur Zhao and Eyal Gruntman and A.

Neuroscientists anticipate analyzing these networks to gain a better understanding of information processing in the brain. In particular, scientists are interested in identifying specific network motifs, i.e., repeating subgraphs of the larger brain network that are believed to be neuronal building blocks. To analyze these motifs, it is crucial to review instances of a motif in the brain network and then map the graph structure to the detailed 3D reconstructions of the involved neurons and synapses. We present Vimo, an interactive visual approach to analyze neuronal motifs and motif chains in large brain networks. Experts can sketch network motifs intuitively in a visual interface and specify structural properties of the involved neurons and synapses to query large connectomics datasets. Motif instances (MIs) can be explored in high-resolution 3D renderings of the involved neurons and synapses. To reduce visual clutter and simplify the analysis of MIs, we designed a continuous focus&context metaphor inspired by continuous visual abstractions [MAAB∗18] that allows the user to transition from the highly-detailed rendering of the anatomical structure to views that emphasize the underlying motif structure and synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, Vimo supports the identification of motif chains where a motif is used repeatedly to form a longer synaptic chain. We evaluate Vimo in a user study with seven domain experts and an in-depth case study on motifs in the central complex (CX) of the fruit fly brain.

As mating behaviors are high-risk and energy-consuming processes, it is critical for animals to make adaptive mating decisions. This includes not only finding a suitable mate, but also adapting mating behaviors to the animal’s needs and environmental conditions. Internal needs include physical states (e.g., hunger) and emotional states (e.g., fear), while external conditions include both social cues (e.g., the existence of predators or rivals) and non-social factors (e.g., food availability). With recent advances in behavioral neuroscience, we are now beginning to understand the neural basis of mating behaviors, particularly in genetic model organisms such as mice and flies. However, how internal and external factors are integrated by the nervous system to enable adaptive mating-related decision-making in a state- and context-dependent manner is less well understood. In this article, we review recent knowledge regarding the neural basis of flexible mating behaviors from studies of flies and mice.

There are two main olfactory receptor gene families in Drosophila, the odorant receptors (ORs) and the ionotropic receptors (IRs). The dozens of odorant-binding receptors in each family require at least one co-receptor gene in order to function: Orco for ORs, and Ir25a, Ir8a, and Ir76b for IRs. Using a new genetic knock-in strategy, we targeted the four co-receptors representing the main chemosensory families in D. melanogaster (Orco, Ir8a, Ir76b, Ir25a). Co-receptor knock-in expression patterns were verified as accurate representations of endogenous expression. We find extensive overlap in expression among the different co-receptors. As defined by innervation into antennal lobe glomeruli, Ir25a is broadly expressed in 88% of all olfactory sensory neuron classes and is co-expressed in 82% of Orco+ neuron classes, including all neuron classes in the maxillary palp. Orco, Ir8a, and Ir76b expression patterns are also more expansive than previously assumed. Single sensillum recordings from Orco-expressing Ir25a mutant antennal and palpal neurons identify changes in olfactory responses. We also find co-expression of Orco and Ir25a in Drosophila sechellia and Anopheles coluzzii olfactory neurons. These results suggest that co-expression of chemosensory receptors is common in insect olfactory neurons. Together, our data present the first comprehensive map of chemosensory co-receptor expression and reveal their unexpected widespread co-expression in the fly olfactory system.", "citations": [{"title": "Neuron-glia interaction at the receptor level affects olfactory perception in adult Drosophila", "paperId": "5bd1e88efdff1d96939c870eba2239606ffee59a"}, {"title": "Comparative transcriptomic assessment of the chemosensory receptor repertoire of Drosophila suzukii adult and larval olfactory organs.", "paperId": "b4edb8cadc03edc9cc38f75b7c9539780af528fd"}, {"title": "Neurogenetic identification of mosquito sensory neurons", "paperId": "5498a60ca06df112f06f2c99e0c173998c4ebc93"}, {"title": "Activation of pheromone-sensitive olfactory neurons by plant volatiles in the moth Agrotis ipsilon does not occur at the level of the pheromone receptor protein", "paperId": "5ce640a657c00456ef0a3155d42c6a8012a9076d"}, {"title": "Experimental and theoretical probe on mechano- and chemosensory integration in the insect antennal lobe", "paperId": "f8a280668d38da1ca9ed70d97961317c4ddd4c09"}, {"title": "Pheromone sensing in Drosophila requires support cell-expressed Osiris 8", "paperId": "5dbac61d9d1bd33ffce553e3b89587315322d662"}, {"title": "Recent Insights into Insect Olfactory Receptors and Odorant-Binding Proteins", "paperId": "c4d3ac934842764f21986705fd30f79515642d4f"}, {"title": "Chemosensory Ionotropic Receptors in Human Host-Seeking Mosquitoes.", "paperId": "61d5d5ed9b2d8aee91d070d2a2b14892c0c49580"}, {"title": "Scent of a human: The mosquito olfactory system defies dogma to ensure attraction to humans", "paperId": "68d8eb21cd4451547ff1cf8859b67dc751a94782"}, {"title": "No functional contribution of the gustatory receptor, Gr64b, co-expressed in olfactory sensory neurons of Drosophila melanogaster", "paperId": "80507d5d69808393fe065c0f40f03240f6d3ad35"}, {"title": "Sensory mechanisms for the shift from phytophagy to haematophagy in mosquitoes.", "paperId": "ec4f94ac27281a9ed8247f6882979858900ead92"}, {"title": "Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels", "paperId": "013253906a4fcb18e615fd51e151107b94aa12be"}, {"title": "Non-canonical odor coding in the mosquito", "paperId": "4ba1a20d41ac0a08980c0dd9340a0e5e5afb2508"}, {"title": "Discrete roles of Ir76b ionotropic coreceptor impact olfaction, blood feeding, and mating in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles coluzzii", "paperId": "9a8422b412e0eff9e48fb025f1c10b59a338757a"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.7554/eLife.72599", "PubMed": "35442190", "CorpusId": 248263921, "PubMedCentral": "9020824"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 14, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Task2022ChemoreceptorCI,\n author = {Darya Task and Chun-Chieh Lin and Alina Vulpe and A.

To study how context-appropriate feeding decisions are generated, we combined synaptic resolution circuit reconstruction with targeted genetic access to specific neurons to elucidate a gustatory sensorimotor circuit for feeding initiation in adult Drosophila melanogaster. This circuit connects gustatory sensory neurons to proboscis motor neurons through three intermediate layers. Most neurons in this pathway are necessary and sufficient for proboscis extension, a feeding initiation behavior, and respond selectively to sugar taste detection. Pathway activity is amplified by hunger signals that act at select second-order neurons to promote feeding initiation in food-deprived animals. In contrast, the feeding initiation circuit is inhibited by a bitter taste pathway that impinges on premotor neurons, illuminating a local motif that weighs sugar and bitter taste detection to adjust behavioral outcome. Together, these studies reveal central mechanisms for the integration of external taste detection and internal nutritive state to flexibly execute a critical feeding decision.", "citations": [{"title": "Taste cues elicit prolonged modulation of feeding behavior in Drosophila", "paperId": "623c268a38a900036c52a8a3a1812ce13767722d"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.7554/eLife.79887", "PubMed": "35791902", "CorpusId": 248219451, "PubMedCentral": "9292995"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 1, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Shiu2022TasteQA,\n author = {Philip K.

Segmentation accuracy is often limited by the preceding step of aligning 2D section images to create a 3D image stack. Precise and robust alignment in the presence of image artifacts is challenging, especially as datasets are attaining the petascale. We present a computational pipeline for aligning ssEM images with several key elements. Self-supervised convolutional nets are trained via metric learning to encode and align image pairs, and they are used to initialize iterative fine-tuning of alignment. A procedure called vector voting increases robustness to image artifacts or missing image data. For speedup the series is divided into blocks that are distributed to computational workers for alignment. The blocks are aligned to each other by composing transformations with decay, which achieves a global alignment without resorting to a time-consuming global optimization. We apply our pipeline to a whole fly brain dataset, and show improved accuracy relative to prior state of the art. We also demonstrate that our pipeline scales to a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex. Our pipeline is publicly available through two open source Python packages.", "citations": [{"title": "Tools for comprehensive reconstruction and analysis of Drosophila motor circuits", "paperId": "1e124b9f834d9f48c547f90650a9fcd5e9e071f8"}, {"title": "Fast imaging of millimeter-scale areas with beam deflection transmission electron microscopy", "paperId": "58443df22b2e215c2a4110719b804d99a0effa1e"}, {"title": "NeuVue: A Framework and Workflows for High-Throughput Electron Microscopy Connectomics Proofreading", "paperId": "4a65612c4fb70aa425c148169c0805429fac9ac0"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.03.25.485816", "CorpusId": 247780789}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 3, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/03/27/2022.03.25.485816.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Popovych2022PetascalePF,\n author = {Sergiy Popovych and T.

However, the downstream neural circuits that process these distinct modalities are incompletely understood in any animal. Using electron microscopy, we have systematically reconstructed the synaptic targets of the photoreceptors specialized to detect color and skylight polarization in Drosophila, and we have used light microscopy to confirm many of our findings. We identified known and novel downstream targets that are selective for different wavelengths or polarized light, and followed their projections to other areas in the optic lobes and the central brain. Our results revealed many synapses along the photoreceptor axons between brain regions, new pathways in the optic lobes, and spatially segregated projections to central brain regions. Strikingly, photoreceptors in the polarization-sensitive dorsal rim area target fewer cell types, and lack strong connections to the lobula, a neuropil involved in color processing. Our reconstruction identifies shared wiring and modality-specific specializations for color and polarization vision, and provides a comprehensive view of the first steps of the pathways processing color and polarized light inputs.", "citations": [{"title": "Behavioral responses of free flying Drosophila melanogaster to shiny, reflecting surfaces", "paperId": "13d1a7e18cd0c3cc4e6fe32596394c52d61a030f"}, {"title": "Eye structure shapes neuron function in Drosophila motion vision", "paperId": "33cc748747d7c91c432214ec3b34c8591f87418c"}, {"title": "Concurrent temporal patterning of neural stem cells in the fly visual system", "paperId": "ac1caec122da70842756f9346ff975e6bbce5a2c"}, {"title": "Motion-sensitive neurons activated by chromatic contrast in a butterfly visual system", "paperId": "438cb214bd17b428e47942ea1b742eddfe19e8d6"}, {"title": "Sensory neuroecology and multimodal evolution across the genus Drosophila", "paperId": "d7538153872a08c63404a9069208ef48e119c617"}, {"title": "Genetic regulation of central synapse formation and organization in Drosophila melanogaster.", "paperId": "b290acab5f0bdbaa832efcef837be6576f95b0a9"}, {"title": "The Neuronal Circuit of the Dorsal Circadian Clock Neurons in Drosophila melanogaster", "paperId": "8ba1c371f34852cee17efcde3606d48b3f7afc05"}, {"title": "Connectome of the lamina reveals the circuit for early color processing in the visual pathway of a butterfly", "paperId": "8f9598183fb07237a633647ef05441d7a90ebc09"}, {"title": "Spatial and temporal control of expression with light-gated LOV-LexA", "paperId": "c000d068ba7eab41b281b415513c5772d073a5d2"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.7554/eLife.71858", "PubMed": "34913436", "CorpusId": 235725297, "PubMedCentral": "8789284"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 9, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Kind2021SynapticTO,\n author = {Emil Kind and Kit D.

On a large study comparing several existing methods across various specimen, imaging techniques, and resolutions, we find that auxiliary learning of LSDs consistently increases segmentation accuracy of affinity-based methods over a range of metrics. Furthermore, the addition of LSDs promotes affinity-based segmentation methods to be on par with the current state of the art for neuron segmentation (Flood-Filling Networks, FFN), while being two orders of magnitudes more efficient—a critical requirement for the processing of future petabyte-sized datasets.

Connectomics provides one avenue to predict nervous system’s function. To test this explicitly, we systematically measure signal propagation in 9,692 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode Caendorhabditis elegans by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory), strength, temporal properties, and causal direction of signal propagation between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal propagation differs from predictions based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show that extrasynaptic signaling not visible from anatomy contributes to this difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle dependent signaling on seconds-or-less timescales that evoke acute calcium transients— often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides and receptors are expressed. We propose that here extrasynaptically released neuropeptides serve a similar function as that of classical neurotransmitters. Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts neural dynamics of spontaneous activity than does anatomy.

Resulting models are exported as triangulated surface meshes and annotated volumes for multiple applications in in silico neuroscience, allowing scalable supercomputer simulations that can unravel intricate cellular structure-function relationships. Ultraliser implements a high performance and unconditionally robust voxelization engine adapted to create optimized watertight surface meshes and annotated voxel grids from arbitrary non-watertight triangular soups, digitized morphological skeletons or binary volumetric masks. The framework represents a major leap forward in simulation-based neuroscience, making it possible to employ high-resolution 3D structural models for quantification of surface areas and volumes, which are of the utmost importance for cellular and system simulations. The power of Ultraliser is demonstrated with several use cases in which hundreds of models are created for potential application in diverse types of simulations. Ultraliser is publicly released under the GNU GPL3 license on Github (BlueBrain/Ultraliser). Significance There is crystal clear evidence on the impact of cell shape on its signaling mechanisms. Structural models can therefore be insightful to realize the function; the more realistic the structure can be, the further we get insights into the function.

The NeuVue platform provides a robust web-based interface for proofreaders to collaboratively view, annotate, and edit segmentation and connectivity data. A backend queuing service organizes proofreader tasks into purpose-driven task types and increases proofreader throughput by limiting proofreader actions to simple, atomic operations. A collection of analytical dashboards, data visualization tools, and Application Program Interface (API) capabilities provide stakeholders real-time access to proofreading progress at an individual proofreader level as well as insights on task generation priorities. NeuVue is agnostic to the underlying data being proofread and improves upon the traditional proofreader experience through quality-of-life features that streamline complex editing operations such as splitting and merging objects in dense nanoscale segmentation. NeuVue heavily leverages cloud resources to enable proofreaders to simultaneously access and edit data on the platform. Production-quality features such as load-balancing, auto-scaling, and pre-deployment testing are all integrated into the platform’s cloud architecture. Additionally, NeuVue is powered by well-supported open-source connectomics tools from the community such as Neuroglancer, PyChunkedGraph, and Connectomics Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE). The modular design of NeuVue facilitates easy integration and adoption of useful community tools to allow proofreaders to take advantage of the latest improvements in data visualization, processing, and analysis. We demonstrate our framework through proofreading of the mouse visual cortex data generated on the IARPA MICrONS Project. This effort has yielded over 40,000 proofreader edits across the 2 petavoxels of “Minnie” neuroimaging data. 44 unique proofreaders of various skill levels have logged a cumulative 3,740 proofreading hours, and we have been able to validate the improved connectivity of thousands of neurons in the volume. With sustained development on the platform, new integrated error detection and error correction capabilities, and continuous improvements to the proofreader model, we believe that the NeuVue framework can enable high-throughput proofreading for large-scale connectomics datasets of the future.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.07.18.500521", "CorpusId": 251021196}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/07/20/2022.07.18.500521.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Xenes2022NeuVue:AF,\n author = {Daniel Xenes and Lindsey Kitchell and P.

Currently, several tools are published for skeletonization as well as morphological and synaptic connectivity analysis using different computer languages and environments. Recently the Julia programming language, notable for elegant syntax and high performance, has gained rapid adoption in the scientific computing community. Here, we present a Julia package, called RealNeuralNetworks.jl, for efficient sparse skeletonization, morphological analysis, and synaptic connectivity analysis. Based on a large-scale Zebrafish segmentation dataset, we illustrate the software features by performing distributed skeletonization in Google Cloud, clustering the neurons using the NBLAST algorithm, combining morphological similarity and synaptic connectivity to study their relationship.

However, connectomic analyses of the lobula, a neuropil putatively dedicated to detecting object-like features, remains underdeveloped, largely because of incomplete data on the inputs to the brain region. Here, we attempted to map the columnar inputs into the Drosophila lobula neuropil by performing connectivity-based and morphology-based clustering on a densely reconstructed connectome dataset. While the dataset mostly lacked visual neuropils other than lobula, which would normally help identify inputs to lobula, our clustering analysis successfully extracted clusters of cells with homogeneous connectivity and morphology, likely representing genuine cell types. We were able to draw a correspondence between the resulting clusters and previously identified cell types, revealing previously undocumented connectivity between lobula input and output neurons. While future, more complete connectomic reconstructions are necessary to verify the results presented here, they can serve as a useful basis for formulating hypotheses on mechanisms of visual feature detection in lobula.", "citations": [{"title": "A visuomotor circuit for evasive flight turns in Drosophila\n", "paperId": "6af23b4b728bf4d40c7cd23d181a061559b06040"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1523/ENEURO.0053-22.2022", "PubMed": "35410869", "CorpusId": 246587415, "PubMedCentral": "9034759"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 1, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.eneuro.org/content/eneuro/9/2/ENEURO.0053-22.2022.full.pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{(田中涼介)2022IdentifyingIT,\n author = {Ryosuke Tanaka (田中涼介) and D.

Yet, it is unclear how neuronal variability originates, to what extent and at what time scales it exists, and what functional consequences it might carry. To assess inter- and intraindividual neuronal variability, it would be ideal to analyze the same identified neuron across different brain hemispheres and individuals. Here, using genetic labeling and electron microscopy connectomics, we show that an identified inhibitory olfactory local interneuron, TC-LN, exhibits extraordinary variability in its glomerular innervation patterns. Moreover, TC-LN’s innervation of the VL2a glomerulus, which processes food signals and modulates mating behavior, is sexually dimorphic, is influenced by female’s courtship experience, and correlates with food intake in mated females. Mating also affects output connectivity of TC-LN to specific local interneurons. We propose that mating-associated variability of TC-LNs regulates how food odor is interpreted by an inhibitory network to modulate feeding.", "citations": [{"title": "Flexibility of neural circuits regulating mating behaviors in mice and flies", "paperId": "459debf1e78a0990b2ca27c70080d0ddb7fc6bf9"}, {"title": "Connectomics and the neural basis of behaviour", "paperId": "e67ce2076b1edb61228f9401bda7a0ea81f3055a"}, {"title": "A Neuropeptidergic Signaling Pathway for Olfactory Gain Modulation", "paperId": "f99d4048e4f9175f6ec30d75c4757f830a2e76b4"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.abm7723", "PubMed": "35179957", "CorpusId": 246974901, "PubMedCentral": "8856614"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 3, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/335278/2/article.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Chou2022Mating-drivenVI,\n author = {Ya-Hui Chou and Chi-Jen Yang and Hao-Wei Huang and Nan-Fu Liou and Michael Raphael Panganiban and David Luginbuhl and Yijie Yin and István Taisz and Liang Liang and G.

In insects, recurrent circuit dynamics in a brain region called the central complex (CX) enable directed locomotion, sleep, and context- and experience-dependent spatial navigation. We describe the first complete electron-microscopy-based connectome of the Drosophila CX, including all its neurons and circuits at synaptic resolution. We identified new CX neuron types, novel sensory and motor pathways, and network motifs that likely enable the CX to extract the fly’s head-direction, maintain it with attractor dynamics, and combine it with other sensorimotor information to perform vector-based navigational computations. We also identified numerous pathways that may facilitate the selection of CX-driven behavioral patterns by context and internal state. The CX connectome provides a comprehensive blueprint necessary for a detailed understanding of network dynamics underlying sleep, flexible navigation, and state-dependent action selection.",

To investigate circuit mechanisms underlying locomotor behavior, we used serial-section electron microscopy (EM) to map synaptic connectivity within a neuronal network that controls limb movements. We present a synapse-resolution EM dataset containing the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of an adult female Drosophila melanogaster. To generate this dataset, we developed GridTape, a technology that combines automated serial-section collection with automated high-throughput transmission EM. Using this dataset, we reconstructed 507 motor neurons, including all those that control the legs and wings. We show that a specific class of leg sensory neurons directly synapse onto the largest-caliber motor neuron axons on both sides of the body, representing a unique feedback pathway for fast limb control. We provide open access to the dataset and reconstructions registered to a standard atlas to permit matching of cells between EM and light microscopy data. We also provide GridTape instrumentation designs and software to make large-scale EM data acquisition more accessible and affordable to the scientific community.", "citations": [{"title": "Virtual Fly

Using a new genetic knock-in strategy, we targeted the four co-receptors representing the main chemosensory families in Drosophila (Orco, Ir8a, Ir76b, Ir25a). Co-receptor knock-in expression patterns were verified as accurate representations of endogenous expression. We find extensive overlap in expression among the different co-receptors. As defined by innervation into antennal lobe glomeruli, Ir25a is broadly expressed in 88% of all olfactory sensory neuron classes and is co-expressed in 82% of Orco+ neuron classes, including all neuron classes in the maxillary palp. Orco, Ir8a, and Ir76b expression patterns are also more expansive than previously assumed. Single sensillum recordings from Orco-expressing Ir25a mutant antennal and palpal neurons identify changes in olfactory responses. These results suggest co-expression of chemosensory receptors is common in olfactory neurons. Together, our data present the first comprehensive map of chemosensory co-receptor expression and reveal their unexpected widespread co-expression in the fly olfactory system.", "citations": [{"title": "Chemosensory Ionotropic Receptors in Human Host-Seeking Mosquitoes.", "paperId": "61d5d5ed9b2d8aee91d070d2a2b14892c0c49580"}, {"title": "Sensory neuroecology and multimodal evolution across the genus Drosophila", "paperId": "d7538153872a08c63404a9069208ef48e119c617"}, {"title": "Chemoreceptor co-expression in Drosophila melanogaster olfactory neurons", "paperId": "8c5346435df56e3f632a010e752980b05cd81cad"}, {"title": "Time-Dependent Odorant Sensitivity Modulation in Insects", "paperId": "ef4fd0a60241060ace7502270d13eaee6e216310"}, {"title": "Pheromone Receptor Knock-Out Affects Pheromone Detection and Brain Structure in a Moth", "paperId": "1dc72593ce26db5d18c40d520abbf9461a955bd1"}, {"title": "Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels", "paperId": "013253906a4fcb18e615fd51e151107b94aa12be"}, {"title": "Non-canonical odor coding in the mosquito", "paperId": "4ba1a20d41ac0a08980c0dd9340a0e5e5afb2508"}, {"title": "Response plasticity of Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons", "paperId": "39d492fd1159944d69cfc8b1d3095fc4921b76cd"}, {"title": "Ir76b is a Co-receptor for Amine Responses in Drosophila Olfactory Neurons", "paperId": "4b9163d386c4e11382fce8059389b850fd7cf81b"}, {"title": "Human attractive cues and mosquito host-seeking behavior.", "paperId": "ac05b4713a43bc11501df485ff217255438fe242"}, {"title": "Evaluation of a high-throughput deorphanization strategy to identify cytochrome p450s important for odor degradation in Drosophila", "paperId": "774474abe6994ebabe789d939b3fc44f2747fac0"}, {"title": "Widespread Polymodal Chemosensory Receptor Expression in Drosophila Olfactory Neurons", "paperId": "4e2cf6eaeac6f71e29576c2585be7d0118402c2a"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2020.11.07.355651", "CorpusId": 236511917}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 12, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Task2020ChemoreceptorCI,\n author = {Darya Task and Chun-Chieh Lin and Alina Vulpe and A.

Previous work in curriculum learning has focused on how curricula can be designed to improve learning of a model on particular tasks. We consider the inverse problem: what can a curriculum tell us about how a learning system acquired a task? Using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and models of common experimental neuroscience tasks, we demonstrate that curricula can be used to differentiate learning principles using target-based and a representation-based loss functions as use cases. In particular, we compare the performance of RNNs using a target-based learning principle versus those using a representational learning principle on three different curricula in the context of two tasks. We show that the learned state-space trajectories of RNNs trained by these two learning principles under all curricula tested are indistinguishable. However, by comparing learning times during different curricula, we can disambiguate the learning principles and challenge traditional approaches of interrogating learning systems. Although all animals in neuroscience lab settings are trained by curriculum-based procedures called shaping, almost no behavioral or neural data are collected or published on the relative successes or training times under different curricula. Our results motivate the systematic collection and curation of data during shaping by demonstrating curriculum learning in RNNs as a tool to probe and differentiate learning principles used by biological systems, over statistical analyses of learned state spaces. trained state. Our results emphasize the importance of studying animals during shaping and the value of curriculum learning in RNNs as a hypothesis test-bed for probing learning principles in the biological brain.", "citations": [{"title": "Confidence-Aware Paced-Curriculum Learning by Label Smoothing for Surgical Scene Understanding", "paperId": "84d499c5b19b26e6a063f5b17a1d6107beabf215"}, {"title": "Neural representational geometry correlates with behavioral differences between monkeys", "paperId": "e22f5ccb19909cb15af9e80be2a24948fabb0344"}, {"title": "Compositional generalization through abstract representations in human and artificial neural networks", "paperId": "a265394d782bbdb869730775399be3dfe45fc1db"}, {"title": "Distinguishing Learning Rules with Brain Machine Interfaces", "paperId": "32117d3160b05650162fd72873e651c45eb7e07c"}, {"title": "Beyond accuracy: generalization properties of bio-plausible temporal credit assignment rules", "paperId": "86ebdbdbe2b33ac8f7c19d86d3704391690f6afd"}, {"title": "An analytical theory of curriculum learning in teacher–student networks", "paperId": "296443aa35868487f7d5e478ca17695d0ad95933"}], "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/iclr/KeppleER22", "CorpusId": 251647193}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 6, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Kepple2022CurriculumLA,\n author = {Daniel R.

However, one faces several challenges when constructing such a model. We often do not have direct experimental access to important modeling details such as single-neuron dynamics and the signs and strengths of the synaptic connectivity. Further, neural activity can only be measured in a subset of neurons, often indirectly via calcium imaging, and signiﬁcant trial-to-trial variability has been observed. To address these challenges, we introduce a connectome-constrained latent variable model (CC-LVM) of the unobserved voltage dynamics of the entire C. elegans nervous system and the observed calcium signals. We used the framework of variational autoencoders to ﬁt parameters of the mechanistic simulation constituting the generative model of the LVM to calcium imaging observations. A variational approximate posterior distribution over latent voltage traces for all neurons is efﬁciently inferred using an inference network, and constrained by a prior distribution given by the biophysical simulation of neural dynamics. We applied this model to an experimental whole-brain dataset, and found that connectomic constraints enable our LVM to predict the activity of neurons whose activity were withheld signiﬁcantly better than models unconstrained by a connectome.

While considerable work has measured the average connectivity of several interneuron classes, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding of the connectivity distribution of distinct inhibitory cell types with synaptic resolution, how it relates to properties of target cells, and how it affects function. Here, we used large-scale electron microscopy and functional imaging to address these questions for chandelier cells in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex. With dense reconstructions from electron microscopy, we mapped the complete chandelier input onto 153 pyramidal neurons. We found that synapse number is highly variable across the population and is correlated with several structural features of the target neuron. This variability in the number of axo-axonic ChC synapses is higher than the variability seen in perisomatic inhibition. Biophysical simulations show that the observed pattern of axo-axonic inhibition is particularly effective in controlling excitatory output when excitation and inhibition are co-active. Finally, we measured chandelier cell activity in awake animals using a cell-type-specific calcium imaging approach and saw highly correlated activity across chandelier cells. In the same experiments, in vivo chandelier population activity correlated with pupil dilation, a proxy for arousal. Together, these results suggest that chandelier cells provide a circuit-wide signal whose strength is adjusted relative to the properties of target neurons.", "citations": [{"title": "CHRNA5 links chandelier cells to protection against amyloid pathology in human aging and Alzheimer’s Disease", "paperId": "0ea9326c03edff6722e8cd55beb6ec360cc5004b"}, {"title": "Two Synaptic Convergence Motifs Define Functional Roles for Inputs to Cochlear Nucleus Bushy Cells", "paperId": "9e1afad59374c22949972964133aab103b86e604"}, {"title": "Regulation of Potassium and Chloride Concentrations in Nervous Tissue as a Method of Anticonvulsant Therapy", "paperId": "e13cfb46c333ae2a3a82b14e3ed2b2fdf8a94d8e"}, {"title": "What is a cell type and how to define it?", "paperId": "34fd8ef9487b2c7363a4aed58ca44d884f8b6a13"}, {"title": "Scalable graph analysis tools for the connectomics community", "paperId": "13ce42428e5b4fa276804cc459256533729ea3ef"}, {"title": "Microglia regulate chandelier cell axo-axonic synaptogenesis", "paperId": "b6d01ed76d9eb96d8d1daf4c873849b0d340b351"}, {"title": "Public Volume Electron Microscopy Data: An Essential Resource to Study the Brain Microvasculature", "paperId": "21ab25072969988a27a8ce2cf1a891d3b5f0fad9"}, {"title": "Reconstruction of neocortex: Organelles, compartments, cells, circuits, and activity", "paperId": "ccaa41be013f921fbd28a9d190689e9a149693a7"}, {"title": "Genetic labeling of axo-axonic cells in the basolateral amygdala", "paperId": "f578f61a01c6e1223acffad7b6637c87fd492ad6"}, {"title": "The geometry of representational drift in natural and artificial neural networks", "paperId": "f4b10a1191048f8c5b77fe1e433c685ab8057290"}, {"title": "Binary and analog variation of synapses between cortical pyramidal neurons", "paperId": "f363c5dfd87e06c553d7b70068f0e1f692559efb"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.7554/eLife.73783", "PubMed": "34851292", "CorpusId": 244773802, "PubMedCentral": "8758143"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 11, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Schneider-Mizell2021StructureAF,\n author = {C.

However, how contextual information shapes neural activity to flexibly alter the patterning of actions is not yet understood. Prior work indicates such flexibility could be achieved via parallel motor circuits, with differing sensitivities to sensory context [1, 2, 3]; instead we demonstrate here how a single neural pathway operates in two different regimes dependent on recent sensory history. We leverage the Drosophila song production system [4] to investigate the neural mechanisms that support male song sequence generation in two contexts: near versus far from the female. While previous studies identified several song production neurons[5, 6, 7, 8], how these neurons are organized to mediate song patterning was unknown. We find that male flies sing ‘simple’ trains of only one syllable or mode far from the female but complex song sequences consisting of alternations between modes when near to her. We characterize the male song circuit from the brain to the ventral nerve cord (VNC), and find that the VNC song pre-motor circuit is shaped by two key computations: mutual inhibition and rebound excitability [9] between nodes driving the two modes of song. Weak sensory input to a direct brain-to-VNC excitatory pathway (via pC2 brain and pIP10 descending neurons) drives simple song far from the female. Strong sensory input to the same pathway enables complex song production via simultaneous recruitment of P1a neuron-mediated disinhibition of the VNC song pre-motor circuit. Thus, proximity to the female effectively unlocks motor circuit dynamics in the correct sensory context. We construct a compact circuit model to demonstrate that these few computations are sufficient to replicate natural context-dependent song dynamics. These results have broad implications for neural population-level models of context-dependent behavior [10] and highlight that canonical circuit motifs [11, 12, 13] can be combined in novel ways to enable circuit flexibility required for dynamic communication.", "citations": [{"title": "Neural coding of distinct motor patterns during Drosophila courtship song", "paperId": "820a1af017fdd6f6a61c722c7bb5fe141521bb55"}, {"title": "Rapid reconstruction of neural circuits using tissue expansion and light sheet microscopy", "paperId": "34313331e3d146173635b7ea4cdec3b648946466"}, {"title": "Behavioral Neuroscience in the Era of Genomics: Tools and Lessons for Analyzing High-Dimensional Datasets", "paperId": "4946afe57483e4336c9c83a2751a5142296551d1"}, {"title": "Neural network organization for courtship-song feature detection in Drosophila", "paperId": "eaa1ad1f740fee4a03079af7764f8807bff9b6bf"}, {"title": "Rapid reconstruction of neural circuits using tissue expansion and lattice light sheet microscopy", "paperId": "b2e6215542288d10b9d5d1ad21d5b49e31eca742"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.11.01.466727", "CorpusId": 242077119}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 5, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/11/02/2021.11.01.466727.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Roemschied2021FlexibleCM,\n author = {Frederic A.

The appropriate SEM approach for a given relocation task not only depends on the desired final image quality but also on the complexity and required accuracy of the screening process. Block-face SEM techniques like Focused Ion Beam or serial block-face SEM are “one-shot” imaging runs by nature and, thus, require precise relocation prior to acquisition. In contrast, “multi-shot” approaches conserve the sectioned tissue through the collection of serial sections onto solid support and allow reimaging. These tissue libraries generated by Array Tomography or Automated Tape Collecting Ultramicrotomy can be screened at low resolution to target high resolution SEM. This is particularly useful if a structure of interest is rare or has been predetermined by correlated light microscopy, which can assign molecular, dynamic and functional information to an ultrastructure. As such approaches require bridging mm to nm scales, they rely on tissue trimming at different stages of sample processing. Relocation is facilitated by endogenous or exogenous landmarks that are visible by several imaging modalities, combined with appropriate registration strategies that allow overlaying images of various sources. Here, we discuss the opportunities of using multi-shot serial sectioning SEM approaches, as well as suitable trimming and registration techniques, to slim down the high-resolution imaging volume to the actual structure of interest and hence facilitate ambitious targeted volume SEM projects.", "citations": [{"title": "Recent technological advances in correlative light and electron microscopy for the comprehensive analysis of neural circuits", "paperId": "8c50ffa15cc4bddf1457d5615af6c6c5c7e337f1"}, {"title": "Reconstructing neural circuits using multiresolution correlated light and electron microscopy", "paperId": "f31b11968661d0f6748cb3ecec7ab5c34178281b"}, {"title": "Single-Neuron Labeling in Fixed Tissue and Targeted Volume Electron Microscopy", "paperId": "b68bebe6414e6e7e9af929c54b37e242edb17452"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fnana.2021.732506", "PubMed": "34720890", "CorpusId": 238639461, "PubMedCentral": "8548362"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 3, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.732506/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'', ''JournalArticle'']{Schifferer2021NiwakiIO,\n author = {M.

To scale up to larger volumes, we have built a computational pipeline for processing petascale image datasets acquired by serial section EM, a popular form of 3D EM. The pipeline employs convolutional nets to compute the nonsmooth transformations required to align images of serial sections containing numerous cracks and folds, detect neuronal boundaries, label voxels as axon, dendrite, soma, and other semantic categories, and detect synapses and assign them to presynaptic and postsynaptic segments. The output of neuronal boundary detection is segmented by mean affinity agglomeration with semantic and size constraints. Pipeline operations are implemented by leveraging distributed and cloud computing. Intermediate results of the pipeline are held in cloud storage, and can be effortlessly viewed as images, which aids debugging. We applied the pipeline to create an automated reconstruction of an EM image volume spanning four visual cortical areas of a mouse brain. Code for the pipeline is publicly available, as is the reconstructed volume.", "citations": [{"title": "Fast imaging of millimeter-scale areas with beam deflection transmission electron microscopy", "paperId": "58443df22b2e215c2a4110719b804d99a0effa1e"}, {"title": "SyConn2: dense synaptic connectivity inference for volume electron microscopy", "paperId": "d6cec5d1abd983b03355b8cd8bf1542123de10b7"}, {"title": "Connectomics of the Octopus vulgaris vertical lobe provides insight into conserved and novel principles of a memory acquisition network", "paperId": "91d5f72f8daca248b7f6bb20f88500e48ce0be16"}, {"title": "Expected affine: A registration method for damaged section in serial sections electron microscopy", "paperId": "5ce819e3fed985e5ba2c695d9a31cd59441288c2"}, {"title": "Quantitative Census of Local Somatic Features in Mouse Visual Cortex", "paperId": "142298f5b11bf2c76536c93aa256835d69dca723"}, {"title": "MorphoFeatures: unsupervised exploration of cell types, tissues and organs in volume electron microscopy", "paperId": "9d65de0286d6a8c0a02922f401ff26afcc2b26a6"}, {"title": "Petascale pipeline for precise alignment of images from serial section electron microscopy", "paperId": "a641df4e738354237c2ba9cdb13c7dbca7d58171"}, {"title": "RealNeuralNetworks.jl: An Integrated Julia Package for Skeletonization, Morphological Analysis, and Synaptic Connectivity Analysis of Terabyte-Scale 3D Neural Segmentations", "paperId": "574fe91260f796820916c763948b7b684295fff0"}, {"title": "Reconstruction of neocortex: Organelles, compartments, cells, circuits, and activity", "paperId": "ccaa41be013f921fbd28a9d190689e9a149693a7"}, {"title": "A scalable and modular automated pipeline for stitching of large electron microscopy datasets", "paperId": "04bf1d96ccb70d065700678de21ca9bb5e156372"}, {"title": "Neural architectures in the light of comparative connectomics", "paperId": "073839c50960c7ef03515aee950605ddbfa83099"}, {"title": "A connectome is not enough - what is still needed to understand the brain of Drosophila?", "paperId": "036fd4bd15746b0eace341dec195c0db021db4ad"}, {"title": "Bayesian reconstruction of memories stored in neural networks from their connectivity", "paperId": "6336feec273c21816e9cef44151c90ca4a2cd0fb"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.08.04.455162", "CorpusId": 236953164}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 13, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/08/05/2021.08.04.455162.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Macrina2021PetascaleNC,\n author = {T.

However, in practice, anatomical connectivity and physiology have been studied mostly separately. Following in the footsteps of previous studies that have combined physiology and anatomy in the same tissue, here we present a unique functional connectomics dataset that contains calcium imaging of an estimated 75,000 neurons from primary visual cortex (VISp) and three higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm), that were recorded while a mouse viewed natural movies and parametric stimuli. The functional data were co-registered with electron microscopy (EM) data of the same volume which were automatically segmented, reconstructing more than 200,000 cells (neuronal and non-neuronal) and 524 million synapses. Subsequent proofreading of some neurons in this volume yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections. The largest proofread excitatory axon reached a length of 19 mm and formed 1893 synapses, while the largest inhibitory axon formed 10081 synapses.

However, homogeneous, high quality electron microscopy staining of large biological samples is still a major challenge. To date, assessing the staining quality in electron microscopy requires running a sample through the entire staining protocol end-to-end, which can take weeks or even months for large samples, rendering protocol optimization for such samples to be inefficient. Here we present an in situ time-lapsed X-ray assisted staining procedure that opens the “black box” of electron microscopy staining and allows observation of individual staining steps in real time. Using this novel method we measured the accumulation of heavy metals in large tissue samples immersed in different staining solutions. We show that the measured accumulation of osmium in fixed tissue obeys empirically a quadratic dependence between the incubation time and sample size. We found that potassium ferrocyanide, a classic reducing agent for osmium tetroxide, clears the tissue after osmium staining and that the tissue expands in osmium tetroxide solution, but shrinks in reduced osmium solution. X-ray assisted staining gave access to the in situ staining kinetics and allowed us to develop a diffusion-reaction-advection model that accurately simulates the measured accumulation of osmium in tissue. These are first steps towards in silico staining experiments and simulation-guided optimization of staining protocols for large samples. Hence, X-ray assisted staining will be a useful tool for the development of reliable staining procedures for large samples such as entire brains of mice, monkeys or humans.", "citations": [{"title": "Femtosecond laser preparation of resin embedded samples for correlative microscopy workflows in life sciences", "paperId": "a486309bbf9a60aaa233593f992a6356aa2cb2fe"}, {"title": "Functional and multiscale 3D structural investigation of brain tissue through correlative in vivo physiology, synchrotron microtomography and volume electron microscopy", "paperId": "a348cca511442e042328dd60eb410f56f1bda20c"}, {"title": "High-contrast en-bloc staining of mouse whole-brain samples for EM-based connectomics", "paperId": "0827f73b8b1c6f5e79da66be837045d2551afd17"}, {"title": "Sample Preparation and Warping Accuracy for Correlative Multimodal Imaging in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb Using 2-Photon, Synchrotron X-Ray and Volume Electron Microscopy", "paperId": "a1372facc07976023225f25082c2d3c3f892364d"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.06.19.448808", "PubMed": "36263931", "CorpusId": 235650178, "PubMedCentral": "9665849"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 4, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Ströh2021InSX,\n author = {Sebastian Ströh and Eric W.

The 1.4 petabyte electron microscopy volume, the segmented cells, cell parts, blood vessels, myelin, inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and 104 manually proofread cells are available to peruse online. Many interesting and unusual features were evident in this dataset. Glia outnumbered neurons 2:1 and oligodendrocytes were the most common cell type in the volume. Excitatory spiny neurons comprised 69% of the neuronal population, and excitatory synapses also were in the majority (76%). The synaptic drive onto spiny neurons was biased more strongly toward excitation (70%) than was the case for inhibitory interneurons (48%). Despite incompleteness of the automated segmentation caused by split and merge errors, we could automatically generate (and then validate) connections between most of the excitatory and inhibitory neuron types both within and between layers. In studying these neurons we found that deep layer excitatory cell types can be classified into new subsets, based on structural and connectivity differences, and that chandelier interneurons not only innervate excitatory neuron initial segments as previously described, but also each other’s initial segments. Furthermore, among the thousands of weak connections established on each neuron, there exist rarer highly powerful axonal inputs that establish multi-synaptic contacts (up to ∼20 synapses) with target neurons. Our analysis indicates that these strong inputs are specific, and allow small numbers of axons to have an outsized role in the activity of some of their postsynaptic partners.", "citations":

However, homogeneous, high quality electron microscopy staining of large 13 biological samples is still a major challenge. To date, assessing the staining quality in electron 14 microscopy requires running a sample through the entire staining protocol end-to-end, which can 15 take weeks or even months for large samples, rendering protocol optimization for such samples 16 to be inefficient. Here we present an in situ time-lapsed X-ray assisted staining procedure that 17 opens the “black box” of electron microscopy staining and allows observation of individual staining 18 steps in real time. Using this novel method we measured the accumulation of heavy metals in 19 large tissue samples immersed in different staining solutions. We show that the measured 20 accumulation of osmium in fixed tissue obeys empirically a quadratic dependence between the 21 incubation time and sample size. We found that potassium ferrocyanide, a classic reducing agent 22 for osmium tetroxide, clears the tissue after osmium staining and that the tissue expands in 23 osmium tetroxide solution, but shrinks in potassium ferrocyanide reduced osmium solution. X-ray 24 assisted staining gave access to the in situ staining kinetics and allowed us to develop a diffusion25 reaction-advection model that accurately simulates the measured accumulation of osmium in 26 tissue. These are first steps towards in silico staining experiments and simulation-guided 27 optimization of staining protocols for large samples. Hence, X-ray assisted staining will be a useful 28 tool for the development of reliable staining procedures for large samples such as entire brains of 29 mice, monkeys or humans. 30", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 253065032}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{None,\n author = {Sebastian Ströh and Eric W.

Previous studies have shown that female flies show decreased sleep after mating, but our understanding of the process is limited. Here, we report that postmating nighttime sleep loss is modulated by diet and sleep deprivation, demonstrating a complex interaction among sleep, reproduction, and diet. We also report that female-specific pC1 neurons and sleep-promoting dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) neurons are required for postmating sleep plasticity. Activating pC1 neurons leads to sleep suppression on standard fly culture media but has little sleep effect on sucrose-only food. Published connectome data suggest indirect, inhibitory connections among pC1 subtypes. Using calcium imaging, we show that activating the pC1e subtype inhibits dFB neurons. We propose that pC1 and dFB neurons integrate the mating status, food context, and sleep drive to modulate postmating sleep plasticity.

To maximize fitness in the wild, an organism must vary the intensity of aggression toward the same or different stimuli. How much of this variation is genetic and how much is externally induced, is largely unknown but is likely to be a combination of both. Irrespective of the source, one of the principal physiological mechanisms altering the aggression intensity involves neuromodulation. Any change or variation in aggression intensity is most likely governed by a complex interaction of several neuromodulators acting via a meshwork of neural circuits. Resolving aggression-specific neural circuits in a mammalian model has proven challenging due to the highly complex nature of the mammalian brain. In that regard, the fruit fly model Drosophila melanogaster has provided insights into the circuit-driven mechanisms of aggression regulation and its underlying neuromodulatory basis. Despite morphological dissimilarities, the fly brain shares striking similarities with the mammalian brain in genes, neuromodulatory systems, and circuit-organization, making the findings from the fly model extremely valuable for understanding the fundamental circuit logic of human aggression. This review discusses our current understanding of how neuromodulators regulate aggression based on findings from the fruit fly model. We specifically focus on the roles of Serotonin (5-HT), Dopamine (DA), Octopamine (OA), Acetylcholine (ACTH), Sex Peptides (SP), Tachykinin (TK), Neuropeptide F (NPF), and Drosulfakinin (Dsk) in fruit fly male and female aggression.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fnbeh.2022.836666", "PubMed": "35517573", "CorpusId": 248231301, "PubMedCentral": "9062135"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2022.836666/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'', ''JournalArticle'']{Palavicino-Maggio2022TheNB,\n author = {Caroline B.

Recent research converges on an emergent mechanistic theory of temporal variability based on attractor neural networks and metastable dynamics, arising via coordinated interactions between mesoscopic neural circuits. We highlight the crucial role played by structural heterogeneities as well as noise from mesoscopic feedback loops in regulating flexible behavior.

In Drosophila such aggressive behaviour has been extensively studied in males. Despite recent work highlighting territorial defence in females, female aggression in Drosophila is still poorly understood. Indeed, whether females compete for mating partners, as males do, has remained unknown so far. In the present work, we report that Drosophila melanogaster females reliably display aggression towards mating pairs. This aggressive behaviour is positively associated with the female’s mating drive and relies heavily on olfaction. Furthermore, we found that food odour in combination with OR47b-dependent fly odour sensing are required for proper expression of aggressive behaviour. Taken together, we describe a social context linked to reproduction in which Drosophila females aspiring to mate produce consistent and stereotyped displays of aggression.

Across species, secondary sexual characteristics such as competitive aggression and territoriality are considered male-specific behaviors. However, although female–female aggression is often a behavior that is displayed almost exclusively to protect the offspring, multiple examples of female–female competitive aggression have been reported in both invertebrate and vertebrate species. Moreover, cases of intersexual aggression have been observed in a variety of species. Genetically tractable model systems such as mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies have proven extremely valuable for studying the underlying neuronal circuitry and the genetic architecture of aggressive behavior under laboratory conditions. However, most studies lack ethological or ecological perspectives and the behavioral patterns available are limited.

We have characterized the structure of egg-laying behavior in Drosophila in detail and observed that the sequence is not merely comprised of motor acts but also acts of sensory exploration that govern the transitions between component actions. We have identified a cluster of internal sensory neurons that provide information about the progression of the egg during ovipositor burrowing, a behavior necessary for the subterraneous deposition of the egg. These neurons impart sensory feedback that allows burrowing to continue to egg deposition or to abort in favor of further exploration. Diminished activity of these neurons upon completed egg expulsion may initiate the transition to the final phase of egg-laying, allowing the cycle to repeat. Sensory feedback therefore plays a critical role at decision points between transitions affording innate behaviors with an adaptive flexibility.", "citations": [{"title": "Odor-gated oviposition behavior in an ecological specialist", "paperId": "e18998c3673ca611516d070f288752c63ec06be6"}, {"title": "A rise-to-threshold signal for a relative value deliberation", "paperId": "f8d9441b1a513babb97c1ece94750077908b7d98"}, {"title": "Neuronal control of suppression, initiation and completion of egg deposition in Drosophila melanogaster", "paperId": "a3e9652baad864a9edff6d9630105e8f979efcca"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.04.03.438315", "CorpusId": 233175398}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 3, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/04/04/2021.04.03.438315.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Cury2021DecisionsIA,\n author = {Kevin M.

We fitted a neural model of decision making (a drift–diffusion model of integration to threshold) to behavioural data from the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus to determine the parameters of temporal integration of acoustic directional information used by male grasshoppers to locate receptive females. The model revealed that males had a low threshold for initiating a turning response, yet a large integration time constant enabled them to continue to gather information when cues were weak. This contrasts with parameters estimated for females of the same species when evaluating potential mates, in which response thresholds were much higher and behaviour was strongly influenced by unattractive stimuli.

While both sexes exhibit aggression, its neuronal underpinnings are understudied in females. Here, we identify a population of sexually dimorphic aIPg neurons in the adult Drosophila melanogaster central brain whose optogenetic activation increased, and genetic inactivation reduced, female aggression. Analysis of GAL4 lines identified in an unbiased screen for increased female chasing behavior revealed the involvement of another sexually dimorphic neuron, pC1d, and implicated aIPg and pC1d neurons as core nodes regulating female aggression. Connectomic analysis demonstrated that aIPg neurons and pC1d are interconnected and suggest that aIPg neurons may exert part of their effect by gating the flow of visual information to descending neurons. Our work reveals important regulatory components of the neuronal circuitry that underlies female aggressive social interactions and provides tools for their manipulation.", "citations": [{"title":

We here test the prediction that females and males should integrate information from courtship signals differently because they experience different payoffs along the speed-accuracy continuum. We fitted a neural model of decision making to behavioral data to determine the parameters of temporal integration of acoustic directional information used by male grasshoppers to locate receptive females. The model revealed that males had a low threshold for initiating a turning response, yet a large integration time constant enabled them to continue to gather information when cues were weak. This contrasts with parameters estimated for females of the same species when evaluating potential mates, in which thresholds for response were much higher and behavior was strongly influenced by unattractive stimuli. Our results reveal differences in neural integration consistent with the sex-specific costs of mate search: Males often face competition and need to be fast, females often pay high error costs and need to be deliberate.

We then fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to estimate the suites of behaviors exhibited by ancestral species, as well as the intra- and inter-species behavioral covariances. We found that much of intraspecific behavioral variation is explained by differences between individuals in the status of their behavioral hidden states, what might be called their “mood.” Lastly, we propose a method to identify groups of behaviors that appear to have evolved together, illustrating how sets of behaviors, rather than individual behaviors, likely evolved.

A dominant role of fru in specifying sex-specific aggressive behavior may underscore a genetic mechanism that allows male-type aggressive behavior to evolve at least partially independently from courtship behavior, which is under different selective pressures.", "citations": [{"title": "Mating pair drives aggressive behavior in female Drosophila", "paperId": "bc9653a608d264b00031e37feb937a31d3fe57a3"}, {"title": "The need for unbiased genetic screens to dissect aggression in Drosophila melanogaster", "paperId": "77d0a5c98e7f6faaacd3c3d2d23fc3b35eab51f9"}, {"title": "Neural Control of Action Selection Among Innate Behaviors", "paperId": "219077e2b7c483024ac9c87a90cd7f0b6ffdbb1e"}, {"title": "The Neuromodulatory Basis of Aggression: Lessons From the Humble Fruit Fly", "paperId": "c189e808578b1d2757ba001011afd8c9f226fd50"}, {"title": "Mate Competition Drives Aggressive Behaviour in Female Drosophila", "paperId": "f59e8085154ed9002550440b0d1c11d9d37d06cd"}, {"title": "Mutually exclusive expression of sex-specific and non-sex-specific fruitless gene products in the Drosophila central nervous system.", "paperId": "078b56eab0aeb000cb85e1909e4fd30372a4e251"}, {"title": "Identification and expression pattern of the sex determination gene fruitless-like in Cherax quadricarinatus", "paperId": "a504f1409213fbc35d362876893c9893b7d6ba1a"}, {"title": "Drosophila tachykininergic neurons modulate the activity of two groups of receptor-expressing neurons to regulate aggressive tone", "paperId": "802ab04966139c5c95aa04131809e4aa65187239"}, {"title": "Limbic Neuropeptidergic Modulators of Emotion and Their Therapeutic Potential for Anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder", "paperId": "381949930cd70c82f94cb9a0865542554d3e0c6b"}, {"title": "Sound production in Drosophila melanogaster: Behaviour and neurobiology", "paperId": "1ff4ab59f46afb6ad6c79f9c25852e5da09a1125"}, {"title": "Quantifying influence of human choice on the automated detection of Drosophila behavior by a supervised machine learning algorithm", "paperId": "4258b2d1be8a8175476017324e4a64e083c3090d"}, {"title": "Contact-Chemosensory Evolution Underlying Reproductive Isolation in Drosophila Species", "paperId": "93e900db532c2e09e762eb3e5f785890fe686a87"}, {"title": "Distinct Roles and Synergistic Function of FruM Isoforms in Drosophila Olfactory Receptor Neurons.", "paperId": "0a9a70c8f08bba06ca7b8667406ef7d174957fa2"}, {"title": "Cell types and neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in Drosophila", "paperId": "df1696050c10fffb86668e9443d39cf72fbddf88"}, {"title": "Fruitless decommissions regulatory elements to implement cell-type-specific neuronal masculinization", "paperId": "f4efa38134797efbd62c8510d370bece9745937b"}, {"title": "A neurogenetic mechanism of experience-dependent suppression of aggression", "paperId": "2912302c8ea94ec38cf68cc0c332457964dd1d3e"}, {"title": "Quantitative comparison of Drosophila behavior annotations by human observers and a machine learning algorithm", "paperId": "3d2cc475c7e29287d943b46ede54fece66b59f92"}, {"title": "Neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression in Drosophila", "paperId": "f18ac21f76fa6b5b89fb45900bc7386ad7e8ceaa"}, {"title": "Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and target preference via sexually dimorphic neurons", "paperId": "3a4e5340f8ad346b518713851dffac0af9716d96"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.7554/eLife.52702", "MAG": "3017332290", "PubMed": "32314957", "CorpusId": 216046197, "PubMedCentral": "7173971"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 19, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Wohl2020LayeredRO,\n author = {Margot Wohl and Kenichi Ishii and Kenta Asahina},\n booktitle = {eLife},\n journal = {eLife},\n title = {Layered roles of fruitless isoforms in specification and function of male aggression-promoting neurons in Drosophila},\n volume = {9},\n year = {2020}\n}\n"}, "referenceCount": 100, "publicationDate": "2020-04-21", "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"source": "external", "category": "Medicine"}, {"source": "external", "category": "Biology"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Biology"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Psychology"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationVenue": {"id": "07365b9a-c0ce-4dd3-b93b-a02e1c81e0c6", "url": "https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/40444/", "issn": "2050-084X", "name": "eLife", "type": "journal", "alternate_urls": ["https://elifesciences.org/", "https://elife.elifesciences.org/", "http://elifesciences.org/"]}, "influentialCitationCount": 0}', '2023-01-27 11:01:58.874368', '2023-01-27 11:01:58.874368', 'Layered roles of fruitless isoforms in specification and function of male aggression-promoting neurons in Drosophila', 2020, false, null, null, null, null);

We show that olfactory discrimination occurs through desensitization of stimulated olfactory receptors by the protein arrestin, that the specific receptors to be desensitized are tagged by the protein GRK-1, and that these processes are not required for discrimination between smells sensed by different neurons.

The majority of behavioral studies were conducted at a group level, and usually the mean behavior of all individuals was considered.

This approach is mostly suited to map and characterize stereotyped neuronal properties between individuals, but lacks the ability to depict inter-individual variability regarding neuronal wiring or physiological characteristics. Recent studies have shown that behavioral biases and preferences to olfactory stimuli can vary significantly among individuals of the same genotype. The origin and the benefit of these diverse “personalities” is still unclear and needs to be further investigated. A perspective taken into account the inter-individual differences is needed to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. This review focuses on olfaction in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster and summarizes previous and recent studies on odor-guided behavior and the underlying olfactory circuits in the light of inter-individual variability.

Here, we address this long-standing question by uncovering a valence map in the olfactory periphery of Drosophila. Within sensory hairs, we find that neighboring ORNs antagonistically regulate behaviors: stereotypically compartmentalized large- and small-spike ORNs, recognized by their characteristic spike amplitudes, either promote or inhibit the same type of behavior, respectively. Systematic optogenetic and thermogenetic assays—covering the majority of antennal sensilla—highlight a valence-opponent organization. Critically, odor-mixture behavioral experiments show that lateral inhibition between antagonistic ORNs mediates robust behavioral decisions in response to countervailing cues. Computational modeling predicts that the robustness of behavioral output depends on odor mixture ratios. A hallmark of complex sensory systems is the organization of neurons into functionally meaningful maps, which allow for comparison and contrast of parallel inputs via lateral inhibition. However, it is unclear whether such a map exists in olfaction. Here, we address this question by determining the organizing principle underlying the stereotyped pairing of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in Drosophila sensory hairs, wherein compartmentalized neurons inhibit each other via ephaptic coupling. Systematic behavioral assays reveal that most paired ORNs antagonistically regulate the same type of behavior. Such valence opponency is relevant in critical behavioral contexts including place preference, egg laying, and courtship. Odor-mixture experiments show that ephaptic inhibition provides a peripheral means for evaluating and shaping countervailing cues relayed to higher brain centers. Furthermore, computational modeling suggests that this organization likely contributes to processing ratio information in odor mixtures. This olfactory valence map may have evolved to swiftly process ethologically meaningful odor blends without involving costly synaptic computation.", "citations": [{"title": "Sensory neuroecology and multimodal evolution across the genus Drosophila", "paperId": "d7538153872a08c63404a9069208ef48e119c617"}, {"title": "Copy number changes in co-expressed odorant receptor genes enable selection for sensory differences in drosophilid species.", "paperId": "64af902299c277e97e3bc557b1a08ad639ab3682"}, {"title": "Odorant inhibition in mosquito olfaction mediated by inverse agonists.", "paperId": "6b6df80607ecebdbc93e229e067635933851fe90"}, {"title": "The neural basis of interspecies interactions in insects.", "paperId": "1878e2cdc650b348c72f0cae6dd8caa884eda9bf"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1073/pnas.2120134119", "PubMed": "35091473", "CorpusId": 246388232, "PubMedCentral": "8812543"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 4, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Wu2022ValenceOI,\n author = {Shiuan-Tze Wu and Jen-Yung Chen and V.

Individual odorant binding “tuning” OrX receptors are expressed by olfactory neurons in basiconic and trichoid sensilla and require the co-receptor Orco. The situation for IRs is more complex. Different tuning IrX receptors are expressed by olfactory neurons in coeloconic sensilla and rely on either the Ir25a or Ir8a co-receptors; some evidence suggests that Ir76b may also act as a co-receptor, but its function has not been systematically examined. Surprisingly, recent data indicate that nearly all coeloconic olfactory neurons co-express Ir25a, Ir8a, and Ir76b. Here, we demonstrate that Ir76b and Ir25a function together in all amine-sensing olfactory receptor neurons. In most neurons, loss of either co-receptor abolishes amine responses. In contrast, amine responses persist in the absence of Ir76b or Ir25a in ac1 sensilla but are lost in a double mutant. We show that responses mediated by acid-sensing neurons do not require Ir76b, despite their expression of this co-receptor. Our study also demonstrates that one population of coeloconic olfactory neurons exhibits Ir76b/Ir25a-dependent and Orco-dependent responses to distinct odorants. Together, our data establish the role of Ir76b as a bona fide co-receptor, which acts in partnership with Ir25a.

This process incorporates a variety of chemosensory receptors and transduction pathways. We have used advanced in vivo gene-editing and -labelling approaches to localize and functionally characterize the ionotropic co-receptor AcIr76b in the malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii, where it impacts both olfactory and gustatory systems. AcIr76b has a broad expression pattern in female adult antennal grooved pegs, T1 and T2 sensilla on the labellum, stylets, and tarsi, as well as the larval sensory peg. AcIr76b is co-localized with the Orco odorant receptor (OR) co-receptor in a subset of cells across the female antennae and labella. In contrast to Orco and Ir8a, chemosensory co-receptors that appear essential for the activity of their respective sets of chemosensory neurons in mosquitoes, AcIr76b-/- mutants maintain wild-type peripheral responses to volatile amines on the adult palps, labellum, and the larval sensory cone. Interestingly, AcIr76b-/- mutants display significantly increased responses to amines in antennal grooved peg sensilla while coeloconic sensilla reveal significant deficits in responses to several acids and amines. Behaviorally, AcIr76b mutants manifest significantly female-specific insemination deficits and, although AcIr76b-/- mutant females are able to locate, alight, and probe artificial blood hosts, they are incapable of blood feeding successfully. Taken together, our study reveals a multi-dimensional functionality of Ir76b in Anopheline olfactory and gustatory pathways that directly impacts the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes. Summary Chemosensory receptors play crucial roles across mosquito lifecycles where they often form functional complexes that require cognate co-receptors. To better understand mosquito chemosensory pathways in the malaria vector mosquito An. coluzzii we have utilized advanced gene editing approaches to localize and functionally characterize the ionotropic receptor co-receptor AcIr76b. Expression of AcIr76b was observed in antennal grooved pegs and other accessory olfactory appendages. Mutagenesis of AcIr76b uncovers both reduced and elevated neuronal responses to amines, which suggests a role in response modulation. In addition to olfactory phenotypes, AcIr76b mutants display significantly impaired mating and blood feeding capabilities.

Individual odor binding “tuning” OR receptors are expressed by olfactory neurons in basiconic and trichoid sensilla and require the co-receptor Orco to function. The situation for IRs is more complex. Different tuning IR receptors are expressed by olfactory neurons in coeloconic sensilla and rely on either the Ir25a or Ir8a co-receptors; some evidence suggests that Ir76b may also act as a coreceptor, but its function has not been systematically examined. This is particularly important as recent data indicate that nearly all coeloconic olfactory neurons co-express Ir25a, Ir8a, and Ir76b. Here, we report the effects of Drosophila olfactory co-receptor mutants on odor detection by coeloconic olfactory neurons and determine their broader impact on gene expression through RNASeq analysis. We demonstrate that Ir76b and Ir25a function together in all amine-sensing olfactory receptor neurons. In most neurons, loss of either co-receptor abolishes amine responses, whereas in ac1 sensilla, amine responses persist in the absence of Ir76b or Ir25a, but are lost in a double-mutant. Such responses do not require Ir8a. Conversely, acid-sensing ORNs require Ir8a, but not Ir76b or Ir25a. Using antennal transcriptional profiling, we find that the expression of acid-sensing IR receptors is significantly reduced in Ir8a mutants, but is unaffected by the loss of Ir25a or Ir76b. Similarly, select OR tuning receptors are also downregulated in Orco2 mutants. In contrast, expression of amine-sensing IR receptors is mostly unchanged in Ir25a and Ir76b mutants. Together, our data reveal new aspects of co-receptor function in the olfactory system. Summary Insect vectors of human disease rely on their sense of smell to locate humans for blood meals. A critical first step in olfaction is the odorant-induced activation of receptors on olfactory neurons. There are two major olfactory receptor families in insects, with each species having dozens of different odorant-binding “tuning” receptors. The receptor complexes also contain non-tuning co-receptors, which are highly conserved across insect species and are required for function. Here we characterize co-receptor mutants with electrophysiological recordings and transcriptome analysis in Drosophila. Our findings resolve the differential co-receptor dependence of olfactory neuron responses to volatile amines and acids. We also report changes in antennal gene expression that result from the absence of these co-receptors. Most notably, the absence of some co-receptors leads to a selective loss of transcript expression for the tuning olfactory receptors whose function depends on the missing co-receptors.

We found that directly after hatching an OR feedback mechanism both directs and refines OR expression. We demonstrate that, as in mice, dLsd1 and Su(var)3-9 balance heterochromatin formation to direct OR expression. We show that the expressed OR induces dLsd1 and Su(var)3-9 expression, linking OR level and possibly function to OR expression. OR expression refinement shows a restricted duration, suggesting that a gene regulatory critical period brings olfactory sensory neuron differentiation to an end. Consistent with a change in differentiation, stress during the critical period represses dLsd1 and Su(var)3-9 expression and makes the early permissive OR expression permanent. This induced permissive gene regulatory state makes OR expression resilient to stress later in life.

Social behaviors such as nursing the queen’s offspring, foraging for food, and nest defense emerge from the collective behavior of the workers. Importantly, these behaviors critically depend on the exchange of information through the detection of chemical cues in the environment. While research efforts have historically aimed to understand the chemical ecology of these social insects, advances in the application of molecular technology over the past decade have facilitated novel studies that bridge the gap between social behaviors and olfaction. Here, we review major advances in the study of molecular olfaction in eusocial ants and highlight potential avenues for future research. Abstract Over the past decade, spurred in part by the sequencing of the first ant genomes, there have been major advances in the field of olfactory myrmecology. With the discovery of a significant expansion of the odorant receptor gene family, considerable efforts have been directed toward understanding the olfactory basis of complex social behaviors in ant colonies. Here, we review recent pivotal studies that have begun to reveal insights into the development of the olfactory system as well as how olfactory stimuli are peripherally and centrally encoded. Despite significant biological and technical impediments, substantial progress has been achieved in the application of gene editing and other molecular techniques that notably distinguish the complex olfactory system of ants from other well-studied insect model systems, such as the fruit fly. In doing so, we hope to draw attention not only to these studies but also to critical knowledge gaps that will serve as a compass for future research endeavors.", "citations": [{"title": "Sparse and stereotyped encoding implicates a core glomerulus for ant alarm behavior", "paperId": "bf34b92167664ef9eaf460501916f1b9b9c800df"}, {"title": "Olfactory Sensitivity Aligns with Caste Revealing Multipotential Minors and Specialized Soldier Majors in Camponotus floridanus Ants", "paperId": "36c1c03d587779c9de33fc46e875069058bafeac"}, {"title": "A tropical lady beetle, Diomus lupusapudoves (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), deceives potential enemies to predate an ant-protected coffee pest through putative chemical mimicry", "paperId": "1cf1b253d62515ffb82d03079fba025e19ae7cf9"}, {"title": "Comparative Antennal Morphometry and Sensilla Organization in the Reproductive and Non-Reproductive Castes of the Formosan Subterranean Termite", "paperId": "d43fc4ae9a39271cf5c1d18373211eefa775490a"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/insects12030252", "PubMed": "33802783", "CorpusId": 232381862, "PubMedCentral": "8002415"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 4, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/12/3/252/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'', ''JournalArticle'']{Ferguson2021AdvancesIT,\n author = {S.

The Anopheles mosquito is the deadliest mosquito species as the insect vector for the malaria-causing parasite, which kills hundreds of thousands every year.

This review takes a detailed look at Anopheles olfaction. We explore a range of topics from chemosensory receptors, olfactory neurons, and sensory appendages to behaviors guided by olfaction (including host-seeking, foraging, oviposition, and mating), to vector management strategies that target mosquito olfaction. We identify many research areas that remain to be addressed.", "citations": [{"title": "Humidity sensors that alert mosquitoes to nearby hosts and egg-laying sites", "paperId": "13d7e85b0b985cd69c1e0f5d6a29e04d4139d3da"}, {"title": "Neurogenetic identification of mosquito sensory neurons", "paperId": "5498a60ca06df112f06f2c99e0c173998c4ebc93"}, {"title": "Technological advances in mosquito olfaction neurogenetics.", "paperId": "574b3bc6851e8ab7694012225c582e0231d27149"}, {"title": "Mapping potential malaria vector larval habitats for larval source management: Introduction to multi-model ensembling approaches", "paperId": "71b206bbc7132992bcd1ac56d93394434d0f8ae1"}, {"title": "Chemosensory Ionotropic Receptors in Human Host-Seeking Mosquitoes.", "paperId": "61d5d5ed9b2d8aee91d070d2a2b14892c0c49580"}, {"title": "Autofluorescent Biomolecules in Diptera: From Structure to Metabolism and Behavior", "paperId": "424a9a48a951f1e95a3d435a74af48b05604dfe8"}, {"title": "Biting Innovations of Mosquito-Based Biomaterials and Medical Devices", "paperId": "ded260e3a830fbfa14f93dcb2c55d0f4526a65c6"}, {"title": "Odorant-receptor-mediated regulation of chemosensory gene expression in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae", "paperId": "715c5cf74a886084cbe78154437ff7807406478e"}, {"title": "Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels", "paperId": "013253906a4fcb18e615fd51e151107b94aa12be"}, {"title": "Human attractive cues and mosquito host-seeking behavior.", "paperId": "ac05b4713a43bc11501df485ff217255438fe242"}, {"title": "Dissections of Larval, Pupal and Adult Butterfly Brains for Immunostaining and Molecular Analysis", "paperId": "50803260f83a6b18bfc4ba700d422f293fc6b8c2"}, {"title": "Unlocking pan-neuronal expression in mosquitoes", "paperId": "724a605fb41b0d26cc61dbeee48c3e2fdce456c2"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1093/chemse/bjab021", "PubMed": "33885760", "CorpusId": 233350870}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 12, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article-pdf/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjab021/38864155/bjab021.pdf", "status": "BRONZE"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'', ''Review'']{Konopka2021OlfactionIA,\n author = {J.

This chemosensory behavior is critical to species survival because females require a blood-meal to reproduce. Humans, the preferred host of Ae. aegypti, produce a complex blend of odor cues along with carbon dioxide (CO2) that attracts females ready to bite. Mosquitoes detect these cues with heteromeric ligand-gated ion channels encoded by three different chemosensory receptor gene families. A common theme in other species is that olfactory neurons express a single receptor that defines their chemical specificity and that they extend axons that converge upon dedicated glomeruli in the first sensory processing center in the brain. Such an organization permits the brain to segregate olfactory information and monitor activity of individual glomeruli to interpret what smell has been encountered. We have discovered that Ae. aegypti uses an entirely different organizational principle for its olfactory system. Using genetic strains that label subpopulations of olfactory neurons, we found that many neurons co-express multiple members of at least two of the chemosensory receptor families. This unexpected co-expression is functional, as assessed by in vivo calcium imaging showing that a given glomerulus is activated by multiple ligands detected by different receptor families. This has direct functional consequences for mosquito behavior. Mutant mosquitoes that cannot sense CO2 can be behaviorally activated by a volatile amine that stimulates the CO2 glomerulus. This non-canonical olfactory system organization featuring overlapping receptor expression may explain the female mosquito’s robust and “unbreakable’ attraction to humans.", "citations": [{"title":

Precise transcriptional changes occur to enable the generation and function of the neural circuits underlying sensory perception. To gain insight into these changes, we generated single-cell transcriptomes of Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), thermosensory and hygrosensory neurons from the third antennal segment at an early developmental and adult stage. We discovered that ORNs maintain expression of the same olfactory receptors across development. Using these receptors and computational approaches, we matched transcriptomic clusters corresponding to anatomically and physiologically defined neuronal types across multiple developmental stages. Cell-type-specific transcriptomes, in part, reflected axon trajectory choices in early development and sensory modality in adults. Our analysis also uncovered type-specific and broadly expressed genes that could modulate adult sensory responses. Collectively, our data reveal important transcriptomic features of sensory neuron biology and provides a resource for future studies of their development and physiology.", "citations": [{"title":

These networks often show key properties like small-worldness and clustering, forming a complex hierarchical topology that is very different from many standard random graphs. Current machine learning techniques are dominated by feed-forward networks without recurrent connectivity, or specialized architectures for gated recurrent connectivity (such as Long-Short Term Memory Networks). Reservoir computing networks, such as echo state networks, represent an exciting alternative form of recurrent networks, which require limited training data compared to other recurrent networks. Echo state networks, however, typically use randomized network topologies. We introduce a novel reservoir computing network, with a hierarchical network structure inspired by organization of biological networks, utilizing hierarchical stochastic block models. We demonstrate the use of this network for predicting dynamic system evolution, and we compare this network to existing echo state network topologies. We find that the best performing networks utilize our new topology, and, for Mackey-Glass system prediction as well as MNIST classification, the overall distribution of solutions is improved. For the Mackey-Glass system, the median population NRMSE improved from 0.856 to 0.08, and for MNIST the median population accuracy increased from 92.5% to 96.8%. This may be preliminary indication of improving network function through changing network topology. The spectral radii of the produced HSBM topologies do not always obey the echo state property, and we show that both the spectral radius as well as common graph metrics do not predict the best performing networks. This argues for further investigation into the structural properties of high performing networks utilizing reservoir computing.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892248", "DBLP": "conf/ijcnn/McDanielVJ22", "CorpusId": 252625896}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'', ''Conference'']{McDaniel2022InvestigatingES,\n author = {Shane McDaniel and Marisel Villafane-Delgado and Erik C.

However, 2D snapshots of a vascular bed capture only a small fraction of its complexity. Recent efforts to synaptically map neuronal circuitry using volume electron microscopy have also sampled the brain microvasculature in 3D. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of 6 data sets spanning different species and brain regions, including 2 data sets from the MICrONS consortium that have made efforts to segment vasculature in addition to all parenchymal cell types in mouse visual cortex. Exploration of these data have revealed rich information for detailed investigation of the cerebrovasculature. Neurovascular unit cell types (including, but not limited to, endothelial cells, mural cells, perivascular fibroblasts, microglia, and astrocytes) could be discerned across broad microvascular zones. Image contrast was sufficient to identify subcellular details, including endothelial junctions, caveolae, peg-and-socket interactions, mitochondria, Golgi cisternae, microvilli and other cellular protrusions of potential significance to vascular signaling. Additionally, noncellular structures including the basement membrane and perivascular spaces were visible and could be traced between arterio-venous zones along the vascular wall. These explorations revealed structural features that may be important for vascular functions, such as blood-brain barrier integrity, blood flow control, brain clearance, and bioenergetics. They also identified limitations where accuracy and consistency of segmentation could be further honed by future efforts. The purpose of this article is to introduce these valuable community resources within the framework of cerebrovascular research by providing an assessment of their vascular contents, identifying features of significance for further study, and discussing next step ideas for refining vascular segmentation and analysis.", "citations": [{"title": "Ultrastructure of Precapillary Sphincters and the Neurovascular Unit", "paperId": "ea42685a3ff41eacfc139f08d57ad992907d68d0"}, {"title": "Individual Astrocyte Morphology in the Collagenous Lamina Cribrosa Revealed by Multicolor DiOlistic Labeling", "paperId": "183d9e40d80efbbb9d8f6cc15eb9886935aedfbb"}, {"title": "Estimates for the astrocyte endfoot sheath permeability of the extra-cellular pathway", "paperId": "cb2a3a48e39303db647bb4bdd52e405ef7b8cb99"}, {"title": "Multiscale imaging informs translational mouse modeling of neurological disease", "paperId": "23910f5c027fd4741c7bd20b4ca4ce90da8dd1a1"}, {"title": "Pericyte heterogeneity identified by 3D ultrastructural analysis of the microvessel wall", "paperId": "fbff9e7efa16f40435c7583c96ed0e18cee9effb"}, {"title": "Reciprocal Interactions between Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells and the Neurovascular Unit in Health and Disease", "paperId": "f2f3f03a97d07d99e9a196dab821d6fa50367414"}, {"title": "A Survey of Visualization and Analysis in High‐Resolution Connectomics", "paperId": "ebaf6fafb4adb7f3657fdbb869249c727ffccf7e"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.02.20.481154", "PubMed": "35450291", "CorpusId": 247077828, "PubMedCentral": "9016339"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 7, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.849469/pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Bonney2022PublicVE,\n author = {Stephanie K.

ATP in neurons is synthesized by glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, both driven by proper NAD+/NADH redox potentials. NMNAT2 is the major neuronal NAD+ synthesizing enzyme and is a key axonal maintenance factor. Here, we show that NMNAT2 co-migrates with fast vesicular cargos in axons and is required for fast axonal transport in the distal axons of cortical neurons. Using SoNar sensor imaging to detect axonal NAD+ and NADH, we show that NMNAT2 is critical in maintaining NAD+/NADH potentials in distal axons. With Syn-ATP sensor imaging to detect synaptic vesicle ATP levels (sv-ATP), we demonstrate that glycolysis is the major provider of sv-ATP and NMNAT2 deletion significantly reduces sv-ATP levels. NAD+ supplementation of NMNAT2 KO neurons restores sv-ATP levels and fast axonal transports in a glycolysis-dependent manner. Together, these data show that NMNAT2 maintains the local NAD+/NADH redox potential and sustains “on-board” glycolysis to meet the bioenergetic demands of fast vesicular transport in distal axons. Intriguingly, mitochondrial respiration contributes significantly to sv-ATP levels in NMNAT2 KO axons. This finding suggests that NMNAT2 deletion induces metabolic plasticity by engaging mitochondria. Surprisingly, NMN, the substrate for NMNAT2 in NAD+ synthesis, supplementation restores sv-ATP and axonal transport in NMNAT2 KO axons with an efficacy similar to NAD+. NMN’s restoration of NMNAT2 KO distal axonal sv-ATP levels and vesicle transport requires mitochondrial respiration, while rescue by NAD+ is independent of mitochondrial respiration. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that NMN rescues glycolysis to restore axonal transport in NMNAT2 KO axons by taking advantage of the compensatory ATP-generating metabolic pathways triggered by NMNAT2 loss.", "citations": [{"title": "Emerging evidence for compromised axonal bioenergetics and axoglial metabolic coupling as drivers of neurodegeneration", "paperId": "6303c9693ae42d2966b54a0943e854242c6ca61c"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.02.06.479307", "CorpusId": 246725916}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 1, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/02/09/2022.02.06.479307.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Yang2022NMNAT2IT,\n author = {Sen Yang and Zhen-Xian Niou and Jacob LaMar and A.

The reliability and specificity of multiphoton optogenetic stimulation were measured across multiple Cre lines, and measurements of connectivity were verified by comparison to paired recordings and targeted patching of optically identified presynaptic cells. With a focus on translaminar pathways, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections from genetically defined presynaptic populations were characterized by their relative abundance, spatial profiles, strength, and short-term dynamics. Consistent with the canonical cortical microcircuit, layer 4 excitatory neurons and interneurons within L2/3 represented the most common sources of input to L2/3 pyramidal cells. More surprisingly, we also observed strong excitatory connections from layer 5 intratelencephalic neurons and potent translaminar inhibition from multiple interneuron subclasses. The hybrid approach revealed convergence to and divergence from excitatory and inhibitory neurons within and across cortical layers. Divergent excitatory connections often spanned hundreds of microns of horizontal space.

This transmission is modulated by a single horizontal cell (HC) type, the only interneuron in the outer retina. Horizontal cells form feedback synapses with cones and feedforward synapses with CBCs. However, the exact computational role of HCs is still debated. Along with performing global signaling within their laterally coupled network, HCs also provide local, cone-specific feedback. Specifically, it has not been clear which synaptic structures HCs use to provide local feedback to cones and global forward signaling to CBCs. Here, we reconstructed in a serial block-face electron microscopy volume the dendritic trees of five HCs as well as cone axon terminals and CBC dendrites to quantitatively analyze their connectivity. In addition to the fine HC dendritic tips invaginating cone axon terminals, we also identified “bulbs”, short segments of increased dendritic diameter on the primary dendrites of HCs. These bulbs are located well below the cone axon terminal base and make contact to other cells mostly identified as other HCs or CBCs. Using immunolabeling we show that HC bulbs express vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters and co-localize with GABA receptor γ2 subunits. Together, this suggests the existence of two synaptic strata in the mouse OPL, spatially separating cone-specific feedback and feedforward signaling to CBCs. A biophysics-based computational model of a HC dendritic branch supports the hypothesis that the spatial arrangement of synaptic contacts allows simultaneous local feedback and global feedforward signaling.", "citations": [{"title": "Super-resolution STED imaging in the inner and outer whole-mount mouse retina", "paperId": "330fe6cc81ea24e82ce404875c6ab76c78dc070d"}, {"title": "Sustained deep-tissue voltage recording using a fast indicator evolved for two-photon microscopy", "paperId": "7be29a1ba9e39c3fe95af75e6dec0f9d40c80638"}, {"title": "Amacrine cells differentially balance zebrafish colour circuits in the central and peripheral retina", "paperId": "e2f5ffe454eb67a47023b3b09a569f7832baa4bf"}, {"title": "Investigation of heterocellular features of the mouse retinal neurovascular unit by 3D electron microscopy.", "paperId": "9e80ed6a209a0691acb5cf6770c1b7daacac8acc"}, {"title": "Transience of the Retinal Output Is Determined by a Great Variety of Circuit Elements", "paperId": "9f81030e61714498b1b54a5647d3fbff001f5c1d"}, {"title": "Visual processing: When two synaptic strata are better than one", "paperId": "8ca63982b3109cc08b09829565b8d8295b75a937"}, {"title": "Amacrine cells shape retinal functions while dynamically preserving circuits for colour vision", "paperId": "938c6d0a362c783f7b095afa4ad2cfde0186f4f6"}, {"title": "Spectral inference reveals principal cone-integration rules of the zebrafish inner retina", "paperId": "e552efb99f53015ef4203beedbfcb218dd689f2f"}, {"title": "The RNA‐binding protein and stress granule component ATAXIN‐2 is expressed in mouse and human tissues associated with glaucoma pathogenesis", "paperId": "024783d1e1d39ff2d2a74cbdca213f2ad8ee39d8"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/780031", "MAG": "2976724692", "PubMed": "34910950", "CorpusId": 204163059}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 9, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics", "Biology", "Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/09/24/780031.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Behrens2019RetinalHC,\n author = {Christian Behrens and Yue Zhang and S.

Throughout the history of neuroscience, microscopy has been a key technology for mapping brain circuits. However, subdiffraction size and high density of synapses in brain tissue make this process extremely challenging. Electron microscopy (EM), with its nanoscale resolution, offers one approach to this challenge yet comes with many practical limitations, and to date has only been used in very small samples such as C. elegans, tadpole larvae, fruit fly brain, or very small pieces of mammalian brain tissue. Moreover, EM datasets require tedious data tracing. Light microscopy in combination with tissue expansion via physical magnification—known as expansion microscopy (ExM)—offers an alternative approach to this problem. ExM enables nanoscale imaging of large biological samples, which in combination with multicolor neuronal and synaptic labeling offers the unprecedented capability to trace and map entire neuronal circuits in fully automated mode. Recent advances in new methods for synaptic staining as well as new types of optical molecular probes with superior stability, specificity, and brightness provide new modalities for studying brain circuits. Here we review advanced methods and molecular probes for fluorescence staining of the synapses in the brain that are compatible with currently available expansion microscopy techniques. In particular, we will describe genetically encoded probes for synaptic labeling in mice, zebrafish, Drosophila fruit flies, and C. elegans, which enable the visualization of post-synaptic scaffolds and receptors, presynaptic terminals and vesicles, and even a snapshot of the synaptic activity itself. We will address current methods for applying these probes in ExM experiments, as well as appropriate vectors for the delivery of these molecular constructs.

However, prior research on correlations between these three factors revealed many limitations. In particular, profiling and modeling of the connectivity of complex neural circuits at the cellular level are highly challenging. To reduce the burden of the analysis, we suggest a new approach with simplification of the neural connection in an array of honeycomb patterns on 2D, using a microcontact printing technique. Through a series of guided neuronal growths in defined honeycomb patterns, a simplified neuronal circuit was achieved. Our approach allowed us to obtain the whole network connectivity at cellular resolution using a combination of stochastic multicolor labeling via viral transfection.

However, organelle segmentation requires a significant amount of manual time. Therefore, several studies have been conducted to improve their efficiency. One such promising method is 3D deep learning (DL), which is highly accurate. However, the creation of training data for 3D DL still requires manual time and effort. In this study, we developed a highly efficient integrated image segmentation tool that includes stepwise DL with manual correction. The tool has four functions: efficient tracers for annotation, model training/inference for organelle segmentation using a lightweight convolutional neural network, efficient proofreading, and model refinement. We applied this tool to increase the training data step by step (stepwise annotation method) to segment the mitochondria in the cells of the cerebral cortex. We found that the stepwise annotation method reduced the manual operation time by one-third compared with that of the fully manual method, where all the training data were created manually. Moreover, we demonstrated that the F1 score, the metric of segmentation accuracy, was 0.9 by training the 3D DL model with these training data. The stepwise annotation method using this tool and the 3D DL model improved the segmentation efficiency for various organelles.", "citations": [{"title": "An annotated instance segmentation XXL-CT dataset from a historic airplane", "paperId": "0f582a978936969369871f6053e5f07c091e6f05"}, {"title": "Folded, undulating, and fibrous doxorubicin sulfate crystals in liposomes.", "paperId": "e76cda131e463f5a76ea620b422d67361f46e3f0"}, {"title": "Morphomics via Next-generation Electron Microscopy", "paperId": "aed0ad5b1eadfbad9a3c6ef84dd7a400bcb9261b"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1093/jmicro/dfab025", "PubMed": "34259875", "CorpusId": 235821767}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 3, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Konishi2021ReducingMO,\n author = {K.

Here we describe a distributed algorithm capable of handling a tremendous number of supervoxels. The algorithm works recursively, the regions are divided into chunks that are processed independently in parallel by multiple workers. At each round of the recursive procedure, the chunk size in all dimensions are doubled until a single chunk encompasses the entire image. The final result is provably independent of the chunking scheme, and the same as if the entire image were processed without division into chunks. This is nontrivial because a pair of adjacent regions is scored by some statistical property (e.g. mean or median) of the affinities at the interface, and the interface may extend over arbitrarily many chunks. The trick is to delay merge decisions for regions that touch chunk boundaries, and only complete them in a later round after the regions are fully contained within a chunk. We demonstrate the algorithm by clustering an affinity graph with over 1.5 trillion edges between 135 billion supervoxels derived from a 3D electron microscopic brain image.", "citations": [{"title": "Petascale neural circuit reconstruction: automated methods", "paperId": "ce7b1bfa25a169d5186ef4a4b458c692a06e11db"}, {"title": "Functional connectomics spanning multiple areas of mouse visual cortex", "paperId": "f0496f38817670b66bd19292842e61272d3b75c0"}], "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/corr/abs-2106-10795", "ArXiv": "2106.10795", "CorpusId": 235490538}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 2, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Lu2021Large-scaleIS,\n author = {Ran Lu and A.

What makes the death of specific neuron types particularly harmful for the integrity and dynamics of the respective network is not well understood. To start addressing this question we used the most up-to-date biologically-realistic dense neocortical microcircuit (NMC) of rodent, which has reconstructed a volume of 0.3 mm3 and containing 31,000 neurons, 36 million synapses, and 55 morphological cell types arranged in 6 cortical layers. Using modern network science tools, we identified “hub-neurons” in the NMC, that are connected synaptically to a large number of their neighbors and systematically examined the impact of abolishing these cells. In general, the structural integrity of the network is robust to cells’ attack; yet, attacking hub neurons strongly impacted the “small worldness” topology of the network, whereas similar attacks on random neurons have a negligible effect. Such hub-specific attacks are also impactful on the network dynamics, both when the network is at its spontaneous synchronous state and when it was presented with synchronized thalamo-cortical visual-like input. We found that attacking layer 5 hub neurons are most harmful to the structural and functional integrity of the NMC. The significance of our results for understanding the role of specific neuron types and cortical layers for disease manifestation is discussed.", "citations": [{"title": "A detailed input-output characterization of single neurons reveals the synaptic basis of spontaneous spiking in recurrent networks", "paperId": "50d41aa14653ff7ebcfbb66528e3e08b1194ee0b"}, {"title": "Generalization of generative model for neuronal ensemble inference method", "paperId": "5e8865b74413920ddaf480a40a13507de7d330cf"}, {"title": "Modeling and Simulation of Rat Non-Barrel Somatosensory Cortex.

This transformation is facilitated by the engulfment and degradation of excess axonal branches and inappropriate synapses by surrounding glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes2,3. However, the small size of phagocytic organelles and the complex, highly ramified morphology of glia has made it difficult to determine the contribution of these and other glial cell types to this process. Here, we used large scale, serial electron microscopy (ssEM) with computational volume segmentation to reconstruct the complete 3D morphologies of distinct glial types in the mouse visual cortex. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the fine processes of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), a population of abundant, highly dynamic glial progenitors4, frequently surrounded terminal axon branches and included numerous phagolysosomes (PLs) containing fragments of axons and presynaptic terminals. Single- nucleus RNA sequencing indicated that cortical OPCs express key phagocytic genes, as well as neuronal transcripts, consistent with active axonal engulfment. PLs were ten times more abundant in OPCs than in microglia in P36 mice, and declined with age and lineage progression, suggesting that OPCs contribute very substantially to refinement of neuronal circuits during later phases of cortical development.", "citations": [{"title": "Igneous: Distributed dense 3D segmentation meshing, neuron skeletonization, and hierarchical downsampling", "paperId": "b6703153b7200dc664e3d523a94df24e2a489815"}, {"title": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells engulf synapses during circuit remodeling in mice", "paperId": "c181e11b75d224673a063ecaf85ff3c9ce3dc8ff"}, {"title": "Norepinephrine enhances oligodendrocyte precursor cell calcium dynamics in the cerebral cortex during arousal", "paperId": "3d4a3557d4925411e7e8767b2c4288f748325cd3"}, {"title": "Development of myelinating glia: An overview", "paperId": "e81cfdb36dae24d6ad7c1bd359c59575249890db"}, {"title": "Reduced and delayed myelination and volume of corpus callosum in an animal model of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders partially benefit from voluntary exercise", "paperId": "819765724c71eb9620c4909f50c1ae0266d5f826"}, {"title": "Uncovering features of synapses in primary visual cortex through contrastive representation learning", "paperId": "b82f01a87fe726d8356f3e44fb9c1ba47d349eac"}, {"title": "Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the lineage progression of fine oligodendrocyte subtypes", "paperId": "afb07e41dd004666d11a5d8f96bf6056f798074f"}, {"title": "Complement Dependent Synaptic Reorganisation During Critical Periods of Brain Development and Risk for Psychiatric Disorder", "paperId": "803600203a15bc70cb37e27ff91bf2069a8fd107"}, {"title": "Oligodendrocytes form paranodal bridges that generate chains of myelin sheaths that are vulnerable to degeneration with age", "paperId": "b21f5e43ac4516d1f0e039e9006b97f76febeddb"}, {"title": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells engulf synaptic inputs in an experience- and microglia-dependent manner", "paperId": "c74fd14cca8ef8aff07f4d6401fabec5643fda6f"}, {"title": "Reconstruction of neocortex: Organelles, compartments, cells, circuits, and activity", "paperId": "ccaa41be013f921fbd28a9d190689e9a149693a7"}, {"title": "Oligodendroglia heterogeneity in the human central nervous system", "paperId": "a91e1509a055b019965255ec3ef9303e604e969b"}, {"title": "Glia-Driven Brain Circuit Refinement Is Altered by Early-Life Adversity: Behavioral Outcomes", "paperId": "954f13ea3cc72a8af6634d9a3ff040b85ad99913"}, {"title": "Structure and function of axo-axonic inhibition", "paperId": "aa2a8a25631e337b5bfe560474ea4eecf2ea8c06"}, {"title": "Insights Into Central Nervous System Glial Cell Formation and Function From Zebrafish", "paperId": "a8e9583774e61a204855c811c693617680fdaa25"}, {"title": "Myelin: A gatekeeper of activity-dependent circuit plasticity?", "paperId": "de4d9dab44bdbeb1ecaa0d37a8ed96afccc27c75"}, {"title": "Mechanisms Underlying Target Selectivity for Cell Types and Subcellular Domains in Developing Neocortical Circuits", "paperId": "d03c5c8bfdc75c7520ba98346124af910092dbfc"}, {"title": "Petascale neural circuit reconstruction: automated methods", "paperId": "ce7b1bfa25a169d5186ef4a4b458c692a06e11db"}, {"title": "Spatial cell type mapping of the oligodendrocyte lineage in the mouse juvenile and adult CNS with in situ sequencing", "paperId": "22decda50a7adc0302bcd2c2fd01cd9dfdb2ff7b"}, {"title": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells sculpt the visual system by regulating axonal remodeling", "paperId": "156cab75205635336f73b416cb83b0902296b400"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.05.29.446047", "MAG": "3171180194", "CorpusId": 235258766}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 20, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/05/29/2021.05.29.446047.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Buchanan2021OligodendrocytePC,\n author = {J.

However, the cell type composition within this distinct subnetwork and how it influences large-scale network dynamics is unclear. Using spontaneous activity recorded from hundreds of cortical neurons in orbitofrontal cortex of awake behaving mice and from organotypic cultures, we show that the rich-club is disproportionately composed of inhibitory neurons, and that inhibitory neurons within the rich-club are significantly more synchronous than other neurons. At the population level, neurons in the rich-club exert higher than expected Granger causal influence on overall population activity at a broad range of frequencies compared to other neurons. Finally, neuronal avalanche duration is significantly correlated with the fraction of rich neurons that participate in the avalanche. Together, these results suggest an unexpected role of a highly connected, inhibition-rich subnetwork in driving and sustaining activity in local cortical networks. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT It is widely believed that the relative abundance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortical circuits is roughly 4:1. This relative abundance has been widely used to construct numerous cortical network models. Here we show that contrary to this notion, a sub-network of highly connected hub neurons (rich-club) consists of a higher abundance of inhibitory neurons compared to that found in the entire network or the non-rich subnetwork. Inhibitory hub neurons contribute to higher synchrony within the rich club compared to the rest of the network. Strikingly, higher activation of the inhibition-dominated rich club strongly correlates with longer avalanches in cortical circuits. Our findings reveal how network topology combined with cell-type specificity orchestrates population wide activity in cortical microcircuits.", "citations": [{"title": "Homophilic wiring principles underpin neuronal network topology in vitro", "paperId": "e93fcb528c971e8ecf30d6d2b21160a21fb8d9ff"}, {"title": "Revealing the Dynamics of Neural Information Processing with Multivariate Information Decomposition", "paperId": "fdd4373973ae15ffc98c3d006103b03b2379a67f"}, {"title": "Common micro- and macroscale principles of connectivity in the human brain", "paperId": "c7b1819ffbfeb376a56cbb5f2c305c4ae044a8e2"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.05.07.443074", "CorpusId": 234474930}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 3, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/05/09/2021.05.07.443074.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Hafizi2021Inhibition-DominatedRS,\n author = {H.

Despite these associations, synaptic properties are heterogeneous in most subclass to subclass connections. The two main axes of heterogeneity are strength and variability. Cell subclasses divide along the variability axis, while the strength axis accounts for significant heterogeneity within the subclass. In human cortex, excitatory to excitatory synapse dynamics are distinct from those in mouse and short-term plasticity varies with depth across layers 2 and 3.

Neurons contain three anatomically distinct compartments – the soma, dendrites, and projecting axons – which have different energetic and biochemical requirements, as well as different mitochondrial morphologies in cultured systems. Here we apply a quantitative three-dimensional electron microscopy approach to map mitochondrial network morphology and complexity in the mouse brain. We examine three neuronal sub-compartments – the soma, dendrites, myelinated axons – in the dentate gyrus and CA1 of the mouse hippocampus, two subregions with distinct principal cell types and functions. We also establish compartment-specific differences in mitochondrial morphology across these cell types between young and old mice, highlighting differences in age-related morphological recalibrations. Overall, these data define the nature of the neuronal mitochondrial network in the mouse hippocampus, providing a foundation to examine the role of mitochondrial morpho-function in the aging brain.", "citations": [{"title": "The times they are a-changin’: a proposal on how brain flexibility goes beyond the obvious to include the concepts of “upward” and “downward” to neuroplasticity", "paperId": "d24e1c6139843c07fe7cec245e187bc0bc358b4b"}, {"title": "Mitochondrial signal transduction", "paperId": "a83707db08a1af609c84b2696b24f818cc0f18a7"}, {"title": "Neuronal mitochondrial morphology is significantly affected by both fixative and oxygen level during perfusion", "paperId": "b124a3bebc007c9b3ebe41441c30f6a7cfd84d2a"}, {"title": "Brain Neurons during Physiological Aging: Morphological Features, Autophagic and Mitochondrial Contribution", "paperId": "44a70665fcdc2faf5dc237921e58a6bea69e74bb"}, {"title": "A Network Approach to Mapping Mouse Brain-wide Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Capacity in Relation to Behavior", "paperId": "d6cc50fbb6ab7fa1dc3339480a17f7046feec97d"}, {"title": "Mitochondrial protein synthesis and the bioenergetic cost of neurodevelopment", "paperId": "6ac0dcc507d85f6e4ec252f5f5104ae5a51d5bd9"}, {"title": "Mitochondrial heterogeneity and homeostasis through the lens of a neuron.", "paperId": "5c4c304e4ad37fef4115df7102ca2577ee221179"}, {"title": "Mitochondrial complementation occurs in rat hippocampal axons and supports the synaptic vesicle cycle", "paperId": "3c15600dbe592a0ad0b36a20c6ec726306e4ae5d"}, {"title": "Neuroimaging Methods to Map In Vivo Changes of OXPHOS and Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Disorders", "paperId": "42722647474d19483ee5d95e1baf84eaa8e3af9e"}, {"title": "Hippocampal Mitochondrial Transplantation Alleviates Age-Associated Cognitive Decline via Enhancing Wnt Signaling and Neurogenesis", "paperId": "9fb7572ec569415180deb50dbbf6119f1fa40b64"}, {"title": "Revealing the Impact of Mitochondrial Fitness During Early Neural Development Using Human Brain Organoids", "paperId": "aadeb837c79c8e71c6018a6716049008fa19e63a"}, {"title": "3D Reconstructions of Mouse Skeletal Muscle Reveal a Decrease in the MICOS Complex and Altered Mitochondrial Networks Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscope (SBF-SEM) Processing of Mouse Muscle Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry", "paperId": "b51b6c3fec1971256b5a5bb8747f32e6f9a593c4"}, {"title": "Dendritic Spine Density Scales with Microtubule Number in Rat Hippocampal Dendrites", "paperId": "b136df84299e7a3c561911da77f9fd423dd92eed"}, {"title": "Seeing Is Perceiving (Believing)", "paperId": "77c22af7ebf583704d55b3fc1eadb8cdf7703fba"}, {"title": "DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission is essential to maintain cristae morphology and bioenergetics", "paperId": "6e6b41df93cb1efb317fa2925eb6c189294a93dc"}, {"title": "Protocols for Generating Surfaces and Measuring 3D Organelle Morphology Using Amira", "paperId": "2db697b5b2a1c3e8bfff7811814afdb51ae3a4bf"}, {"title": "Temporal Profiling of the Cortical Synaptic Mitochondrial Proteome Identifies Ageing Associated Regulators of Stability", "paperId": "8caafea2c7e3b011b115e835c9a2b246c3019bb9"}, {"title": "Practices for Measuring 3D Organelle Morphology and Generating Surfaces with Amira", "paperId": "15348c5fe50becbfb3859f0f2f0de7110c8623f3"}, {"title": "High-throughput high-dynamic range imaging by spatiotemporally structured illumination", "paperId": "8016372074a87435f98f2abab8e328e8a4bab6d0"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.02.26.433056", "PubMed": "34380033", "CorpusId": 232081860, "PubMedCentral": "8423436"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 19, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.cell.com/article/S2211124721009396/pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Faitg20213DNM,\n author = {J.

However, scarce data about neuronal connections, particularly in primates, makes such comparisons difficult. We use large volume electron microscopy to address this gap, reconstructing 11,415 synapses onto morphologically equivalent adult primate and mouse neurons in Layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex (V1). Neurons from both species distribute in cortex at similar densities, have similar somatic volumes, and dendritic branching patterns, but primate excitatory and inhibitory neurons receive ∼4 times fewer excitatory and inhibitory connections than equivalent mouse neurons. The reduction in excitatory inputs is larger, resulting in a 2-fold decreased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory inputs in primate neurons. Finally, despite reductions in inhibitory synapse number, neighboring excitatory primate neurons are co-innervated by inhibitory axons at rates and proportions similar to mouse neurons. We present a first glimpse of large-scale connectivity comparisons across mouse and primate brains which underscore the need for future analyses since such differences likely represent a substantial part of how mouse and primate brains differ.", "citations": [{"title": "Distributed functions of prefrontal and parietal cortices during sequential categorical decisions", "paperId": "f8a17a034a9b30f6cb1532d98c1a443a4fb571c9"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2020.09.24.311852", "MAG": "3089247728", "CorpusId": 221952809}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 1, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/12/20/2020.09.24.311852.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Wildenberg2020PrimateNC,\n author = {G.A.

We present the largest map of connectivity to date between cortical neurons of a defined type (L2/3 pyramidal cells), which was enabled by automated analysis of serial section electron microscopy images with improved handling of image defects. We used the map to identify constraints on the learning algorithms employed by the cortex. Previous cortical studies modeled a continuum of synapse sizes (Arellano et al., 2007) by a log-normal distribution (Loewenstein, Kuras and Rumpel, 2011; de Vivo et al., 2017; Santuy et al., 2018). A continuum is consistent with most neural network models of learning, in which synaptic strength is a continuously graded analog variable. Here we show that synapse size, when restricted to synapses between L2/3 pyramidal cells, is well-modeled by the sum of a binary variable and an analog variable drawn from a log-normal distribution. Two synapses sharing the same presynaptic and postsynaptic cells are known to be correlated in size (Sorra and Harris, 1993; Koester and Johnston, 2005; Bartol et al., 2015; Kasthuri et al., 2015; Dvorkin and Ziv, 2016; Bloss et al., 2018; Motta et al., 2019). We show that the binary variables of the two synapses are highly correlated, while the analog variables are not. Binary variation could be the outcome of a Hebbian or other synaptic plasticity rule depending on activity signals that are relatively uniform across neuronal arbors, while analog variation may be dominated by other influences. We discuss the implications for the stability-plasticity dilemma.", "citations": [{"title": "RoboEM: automated 3D flight tracing for synaptic-resolution connectomics", "paperId":

However, emerging data have revealed surprising diversity in neuron types, synaptic connections, and plasticity mechanisms, both locally and regionally within the cerebellar cortex. In light of these findings, it is not surprising that attempts to generate a holistic model of cerebellar learning across different behaviors have not been successful. While the cerebellum remains an ideal system for linking neuronal function with behavior, it is necessary to update the cerebellar circuit framework to achieve its great promise.

While anatomical studies have suggested the presence of cerebellar projections to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the nature and function of these connections (Cb-SNc) is unknown. Here we show that the Cb-SNc form monosynaptic glutamatergic synapses with both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. Optogenetic activation Cb-SNc axons in the SNc rapidly increases SNc activity, elevates striatal dopamine levels, and increases the probability of locomotion. During ongoing behavior, Cb-SNc axons are bilaterally activated prior to ambulation and unilateral lever manipulation. The Cb-SNc axons show prominent activation to water reward, and higher activation for sweet water, suggesting that the pathway also encodes reward value. Thus, the cerebellum directly, rapidly, and effectively modulates basal ganglia dopamine levels and conveys information related to movement initiation, vigor, and possibly reward processing.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.05.20.492532", "CorpusId": 248990766}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/05/22/2022.05.20.492532.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Washburn2022CerebellumDM,\n author = {Samantha Washburn and M.

How the cerebellum supports affective function remains poorly understood. The short-latency (just a few ms) functional connections that were identified between the cerebellum and amygdala -a structure crucial for the processing of emotion and valence-more than 4 decades ago raise the exciting, yet untested, possibility that a cerebellum-amygdala pathway communicates information important for emotion. The major hurdle in rigorously testing this possibility is the lack of knowledge about the anatomy and functional connectivity of this pathway. Our initial anatomical tracing studies in mice excluded the existence of a direct monosynaptic pathway between cerebellum and amygdala. Using transneuronal tracing techniques, we have identified a novel disynaptic pathway that connects the cerebellar output nuclei to the basolateral amygdala. This pathway recruits the understudied intralaminar thalamus as a node. Using ex vivo optophysiology and super-resolution microscopy, we provide the first evidence for the functionality of the pathway, thus offering a missing mechanistic link between the cerebellum and amygdala. This discovery provides a connectivity blueprint between the cerebellum and a key structure of the limbic system. As such, it is the requisite first step toward obtaining new knowledge about cerebellar function in emotion, thus fundamentally advancing understanding of the neurobiology of emotion, which is perturbed in mental and autism spectrum disorders.", "citations": [{"title": "cATR Tracing Approach to Identify Individual Intermediary Neurons Based on Their Input and Output: A Proof-of-Concept Study Connecting Cerebellum and Central Hubs Implicated in Developmental Disorders", "paperId": "41a37ad489e41dfe492f01334f9d868c5e3c8426"}, {"title": "The Cerebellum as an Embodying Machine.", "paperId": "5322253be27b1410b6e626d2bdebd4654b6ee2cf"}, {"title": "A Purkinje cell to parabrachial nucleus pathway enables broad cerebellar influence over the forebrain", "paperId": "0b719fd1a456adb796afab66e9268be2a314ee44"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fnsys.2022.879634", "PubMed": "35645738", "CorpusId": 246663656, "PubMedCentral": "9136059"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 3, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.879634/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Jung2022NovelCC,\n author = {Se Jung Jung and Ksenia Y.

Specifically, recombinant one-step rabies viruses (RABV) have been instrumental in the widespread application of viral circuit mapping, as these viruses have enabled labs to map the direct inputs onto defined cell populations. Within the neuroscience community, it is widely believed that RABV spreads directly between neurons via synaptic connections, a hypothesis based principally on two observations. First, the virus labels neurons in a pattern consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Second, few glial cells appear to be infected following RABV injections, despite the fact that glial cells are abundant in the brain. However, there is no direct evidence that RABV can actually be transmitted through synaptic connections. Here we review the immunosubversive mechanisms that are critical to RABV’s success for infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS). These include interfering with and ultimately killing migratory T cells while maintaining levels of interferon (IFN) signaling in the brain parenchyma. Finally, we critically evaluate studies that support or are against synaptically-restricted RABV transmission and the implications of viral-host immune responses for RABV transmission in the brain.", "citations": [{"title": "Uncovering the Connectivity Logic of the Ventral Tegmental Area", "paperId": "0890f1b30df16a541bd78b6b636c9b139f547775"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fncel.2021.720807", "PubMed": "34671244", "CorpusId": 238254772, "PubMedCentral": "8521040"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 1, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.720807/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'', ''JournalArticle'']{Beier2021TheSO,\n author = {Kevin T.

We believe a new approach to neural modeling will beneﬁt the ’third wave’ of AI. The ‘horizontal’ plane consists of an adaptive network of neurons connected by transmission links which generates spatio-temporal spike patterns. This ﬁts with standard computational neuroscience approaches. Additionally, for each individual neuron, there is a ’vertical’ part consisting of internal adaptive parameters steering the external, membrane-expressed parameters which are involved in neural transmission. Each neuron has a vertical modular system of parameters, corresponding to (a) external parameters at the membrane layer, divided into compartments (spines, boutons), (b) internal parameters in the submembrane zone and the cytoplasm with its intracellular protein signaling network, and (c) ‘core’ parameters in the nucleus for genetic and epigenetic information. In such models, each node (=neuron) in the horizontal network has its own internal memory. Neural transmission and information storage are systematically separated, an important conceptual advance over synaptic weight models. We discuss the membrane-based (’external’) ﬁltering and selection of outside signals for processing vs. signal loss by fast ﬂuctuations and the neuron-internal computing strategies from intracellular protein signaling to the nucleus as the ’core’ system. We want to show that the individual neuron has an important role in the computation of signals, and that many assumptions derived from the synaptic weight adjustment hypothesis of memory may not hold in a real brain. Not every transmission event leaves a trace, and the neuron is a self-programming device, rather than passively determined by current input. Ultimately we strive to build a ﬂexible memory system that processes facts and events automatically.

We previously showed that social experience and pheromone signaling modulate chromatin around behavioral switch gene fruitless, which encodes a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for male behaviors. Fruitless drives social experience dependent modulation of courtship behaviors and pheromone responses in sensory neurons, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this neuromodulation remain less clear. To identify the molecular mechanisms driving social experience-dependent neuromodulation, we performed RNA-seq from antennal samples of mutants in pheromone receptors and fruitless, as well as grouped or isolated wild-type males. We found that loss of pheromone detection differentially alters the levels of fruitless exons suggesting changes in splicing patterns. In addition, many Fruitless target neuromodulatory genes, such as neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, ion and membrane transporters, and odorant binding proteins are differentially regulated by social context and pheromone signaling. Recent studies showed that social experience and juvenile hormone signaling coregulate fru chromatin to modify pheromone responses in olfactory neurons. Interestingly, genes involved in juvenile hormone metabolism are also misregulated in different social contexts and mutant backgrounds. Our results suggest that modulation of neuronal activity and behaviors in response to social experience and pheromone signaling likely arise due to large-scale changes in transcriptional programs for neuromodulators downstream of behavioral switch gene function.", "citations": [{"title": "The effect of Drosophila attP40 background on the glomerular organization of Or47b olfactory receptor neurons", "paperId": "8bd327d0bdab35db226615915c2d0a303ce583ca"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2021.06.18.449021", "CorpusId": 251694852}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 1, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/08/16/2021.06.18.449021.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Deanhardt2022SocialEA,\n author = {B.

Mate selection thus requires mutual recognition across diverse social interactions based on distinct sensory signals. These sex differences in courtship and mating behaviors correspond to differences in sensory systems and downstream neural substrates engaged to recognize and respond to courtship signals. In many rodents, males tend to rely heavily on volatile olfactory and pheromone cues, while females appear to be guided more by a combination of these chemosensory signals with acoustic cues in the form of ultrasonic vocalizations. The mechanisms by which chemical and acoustic cues are integrated to control behavior are understudied in mating but are known to be important in the control of maternal behaviors. Socially monogamous species constitute a behaviorally distinct group of rodents. In these species, anatomic differences between males and females outside the nervous system are less prominent than in species with non-monogamous mating systems, and both sexes engage in more symmetric social behaviors and form attachments. Nevertheless, despite the apparent similarities in behaviors displayed by monogamous males and females, the circuitry supporting social, mating, and attachment behaviors in these species is increasingly thought to differ between the sexes. Sex differences in sensory modalities most important for mate recognition in across species are of particular interest and present a wealth of questions yet to be answered. Here, we discuss how distinct sensory cues may be integrated to drive social and attachment behaviors in rodents, and the differing roles of specific sensory systems in eliciting displays of behavior by females or males.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fncir.2022.944895", "PubMed": "35958042", "CorpusId": 251022129, "PubMedCentral": "9358210"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2022.944895/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'', ''JournalArticle'']{Hoglen2022Cupid’sQI,\n author = {Nerissa E G Hoglen and Devanand S Manoli},\n booktitle = {Frontiers in Neural Circuits},\n journal = {Frontiers in Neural Circuits},\n title = {Cupid’s quiver: Integrating sensory cues in rodent mating systems},\n volume = {16},\n year = {2022}\n}\n"}, "referenceCount": 163, "publicationDate": "2022-07-25", "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"source": "external", "category": "Medicine"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Biology"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Psychology"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationVenue": {"id": "09dc8437-eb87-49ec-a21b-ecb208a5890b", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neural-circuits", "issn": "1662-5110", "name": "Frontiers in Neural Circuits", "type": "journal", "alternate_urls": ["http://www.frontiersin.org/neuralcircuits/", "http://www.frontiersin.org/neural_circuits"], "alternate_names": ["Front Neural Circuit"]}, "influentialCitationCount": 0}', '2023-01-27 11:11:23.223751', '2023-01-27 11:11:23.223751', 'Cupid’s quiver: Integrating sensory cues in rodent mating systems', 2022, false, null, null, null, null);

However, while functional diversity among PVT circuits has often been linked to cellular differences, the molecular identity and spatial distribution of PVT cell types remains unclear. To address this gap, here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and identified five molecularly distinct PVT neuronal subtypes. Additionally, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization of top marker genes revealed that PVT subtypes are organized by a combination of previously unidentified molecular gradients. Lastly, comparing our dataset with a recently published single-cell sequencing atlas of thalamus yielded novel insight into the PVT’s connectivity with cortex, including unexpected innervation of auditory and visual areas. This comparison also revealed that our data contains a largely non-overlapping transcriptomic map of multiple midline thalamic nuclei. Collectively, our findings uncover previously unknown features of the molecular diversity and anatomical organization of the PVT and provide a valuable resource for future investigations.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.07.19.500649", "CorpusId": 251021326}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/07/20/2022.07.19.500649.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Gao2022MolecularAS,\n author = {Cl Gao and Chiraag A.

It is widely believed to function as a system of ‘labeled lines’, containing behavior-specific neurons with characteristic transcriptomic and connectomic profiles. This view however fails to explain why, although activation of estrogen receptor-1 (Esr1) expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) promotes aggression, few VMHvl neurons are tuned to attack. To address this paradox, we adopted an unsupervised dynamical systems framework to analyze population activity among VMHvlEsr1 neurons during aggression. We discovered that this activity contains an “integration” dimension exhibiting slow-ramping dynamics and persistent activity that correlates with escalating aggressiveness. These dynamics are implemented as an approximate line attractor in state space. Our analysis suggests a function for VMHvl to encode the intensity of behavior-relevant motive states using line attractors.

In insects, the mushroom body (MB) has been implicated in forming associative memories and in assessing the appetitive or aversive valence of sensory stimuli to bias approach versus avoidance behavior. To study the MB involvement in innate feeding behavior we performed extracellular single-unit recordings from MB output neurons (MBONs) while simultaneously monitoring a defined feeding behavior in response to timed odor stimulation in naïve cockroaches. All animals expressed the feeding behavior almost exclusively in response to food odors. Likewise, MBON responses were invariably and strongly tuned to the same odors. Importantly, MBON responses were restricted to behaviorally responded trials, which allowed the accurate prediction of the occurrence versus non-occurrence of the feeding behavior in individual trials from the neuronal population activity. During responded trials the neuronal activity generally preceded the onset of the feeding behavior, indicating a causal relation. Our results contest the predominant view that MBONs encode stimulus valence. Rather, we conclude that the MB output dynamically encodes the behavioral decision to inform downstream motor networks.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.09.14.507924", "CorpusId": 252384663}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/09/16/2022.09.14.507924.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Arıcan2022TheMB,\n author = {C.

In Drosophila, the only gene of the subfamily generates two main products, dlgA, broadly expressed, and dlgS97, restricted to the nervous system. In the Drosophila brain, NRs are expressed in the adult brain and are involved in memory, however, the role of Dlg in these processes and its relationship with NRs has been scarcely explored. Here, we show that the dlg mutants display defects in short-term memory in the olfactory associative-learning paradigm. These defects are dependent on the presence of DlgS97 in the Mushroom Body (MB) synapses. Moreover, Dlg is immunoprecipitated with NRs in the adult brain. Dlg is also expressed in the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) pre and post-synaptically and is important for development and synaptic function, however, NR is absent in this synapse. Despite that, we found changes in the short-term plasticity paradigms in dlg mutant larval NMJ. Together our results show that larval NMJ and the adult brain relies on Dlg for short-term memory/plasticity, but the mechanisms differ in the two types of synapses.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/ijms23169187", "PubMed": "36012453", "CorpusId": 251663268, "PubMedCentral": "9409279"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/16/9187/pdf?version=1660641458", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Bertin2022DlgIR,\n author = {F.

Odor-guided locomotion, like most other behaviors, is highly variable. Variability in behavior can arise at many nodes along the circuit that performs sensorimotor transformation. We review these sources of variability in the context of the Drosophila olfactory system. While these sources of variability are important, using a model for locomotion, we show that another important contributor to behavioral variability is the stochastic nature of decision-making during locomotion as well as the persistence of these decisions: Flies choose the speed and curvature stochastically from a distribution and locomote with the same speed and curvature for extended periods. This stochasticity in locomotion will result in variability in behavior even if there is no noise in sensorimotor transformation. Overall, the noise in sensorimotor transformation is amplified by mechanisms of locomotion making odor-guided locomotion in flies highly variable.", "citations": [{"title": "Scalable Apparatus to Measure Posture and Locomotion (SAMPL): a high-throughput solution to study unconstrained vertical behavior in small animals", "paperId": "4a1e35ef6afe94d569103a262c8a3b099e8e3b86"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fnbeh.2022.871884", "PubMed": "35600988", "CorpusId": 248507779, "PubMedCentral": "9115574"}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 1, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2022.871884/pdf", "status": "GOLD"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''Review'', ''JournalArticle'']{Tao2022MechanismsOV,\n author = {Liangyu Tao and Vikas Bhandawat},\n booktitle = {Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience},\n journal = {Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience},\n title = {Mechanisms of Variability Underlying Odor-Guided Locomotion},\n volume = {16},\n year = {2022}\n}\n"}, "referenceCount": 115, "publicationDate": "2022-05-04", "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"source": "external", "category": "Medicine"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Biology"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Psychology"}, {"source": "s2-fos-model", "category": "Engineering"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationVenue": {"id": "810ce699-eb80-4394-8aac-a6d3c87840ed", "url": "http://www.frontiersin.org/behavioral_neuroscience", "issn": "1662-5153", "name": "Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience", "type": "journal", "alternate_urls": ["http://www.frontiersin.org/behavioralneuroscience/", "https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience"], "alternate_names": ["Front Behav Neurosci"]}, "influentialCitationCount": 0}', '2023-01-27 11:12:42.984461', '2023-01-27 11:12:42.984461', 'Mechanisms of Variability Underlying Odor-Guided Locomotion', 2022, false, null, null, null, null);

Axonal compartmentalization may enable localized, presynaptic plasticity to alter neuronal output in a flexible, experience-dependent manner. Here we show that olfactory learning generates compartmentalized, bidirectional plasticity of acetylcholine release that varies across the longitudinal compartments of Drosophila mushroom body (MB) axons. The directionality of the learning-induced plasticity depends on the valence of the learning event (aversive vs. appetitive), varies linearly across proximal to distal compartments following appetitive conditioning, and correlates with learning-induced changes in downstream mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that modulate behavioral action selection. Potentiation of acetylcholine release was dependent on the CaV2.1 calcium channel subunit cacophony. In addition, contrast between the positive conditioned stimulus and other odors required the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R), which was required to maintain responsivity to odors in untrained conditions. Downstream from the mushroom body, a set of MBONs that receive their input from the γ3 MB compartment were required for normal appetitive learning, suggesting that they represent a key node through which discriminative effects influence appetitive memory and decision-making. These data demonstrate that learning drives valence-correlated, compartmentalized, bidirectional potentiation and depression of synaptic neurotransmitter release, which rely on distinct mechanisms and are distributed across axonal compartments in a learning circuit.", "citations": [{"title": "Mechanisms controlling the trafficking, localization, and abundance of presynaptic Ca2+ channels", "paperId": "06720d2c308bb83982ab69a8e3c45fd99de4e9ae"}, {"title": "Postsynaptic plasticity of cholinergic synapses underlies the induction and expression of appetitive and familiarity memories in Drosophila", "paperId": "e9c16adbe744d5b41ce0aba74315a4061a6bf303"}, {"title": "One engram two readouts: stimulus dynamics switch a learned behavior in Drosophila", "paperId": "d0c772967d22ed3064619cab8f238d5c57b88793"}, {"title": "Local 5-HT signal bi-directionally regulates the coincidence time window of associative learning", "paperId": "81ccc0423c9759039d787471946b4048a00174ce"}, {"title": "Regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channel abundance at active zones through a balance of delivery and turnover", "paperId": "30f0148863e943658fa5d2f4d0b941d626b9713b"}, {"title": "Postsynaptic plasticity of cholinergic synapses underlies the 2 induction and expression of appetitive and familiarity 3 memories in Drosophila 4 5 6 7", "paperId": "3778e26707b2f87fc221b3242ce3f14af824bd64"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.7554/eLife.76712", "PubMed": "35285796", "CorpusId": 235414175, "PubMedCentral": "8956283"}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 6, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Stahl2021AssociativeLD,\n author = {Aaron L.

However, deficiencies in climate models’ representations of key mechanisms within the process chains that drive weather reduce our confidence in estimates of the human influence on extreme events. We propose that using forecast models that successfully predicted the event in question could increase the robustness of such estimates. Using a successful forecast means we can be confident that the model is able to faithfully represent the characteristics of the specific extreme event. We use this forecast-based methodology to estimate the direct radiative impact of increased CO2 concentrations (one component, but not the entirety, of human influence) on the European heatwave of February 2019. Attribution of extreme weather events has expanded rapidly as a field over the past decade. However, deficiencies in climate model representation of key dynamical drivers of extreme events have led to some concerns over the robustness of climate model–based attribution studies. It has also been suggested that the unconditioned risk-based approach to event attribution may result in false negative results due to dynamical noise overwhelming any climate change signal. The “storyline” attribution framework, in which the impact of climate change on individual drivers of an extreme event is examined, aims to mitigate these concerns. Here we propose a methodology for attribution of extreme weather events using the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) medium-range forecast model that successfully predicted the event. The use of a successful forecast ensures not only that the model is able to accurately represent the event in question, but also that the analysis is unequivocally an attribution of this specific event, rather than a mixture of multiple different events that share some characteristic. Since this attribution methodology is conditioned on the component of the event that was predictable at forecast initialization, we show how adjusting the lead time of the forecast can flexibly set the level of conditioning desired. This flexible adjustment of the conditioning allows us to synthesize between a storyline (highly conditioned) and a risk-based (relatively unconditioned) approach. We demonstrate this forecast-based methodology through a partial attribution of the direct radiative effect of increased CO2 concentrations on the exceptional European winter heatwave of February 2019.", "citations": [{"title": "Prediction and projection of heatwaves", "paperId": "8051868d9db4a2a088dafdf58b08fab4b816b59e"}, {"title": "On the role of anthropogenic warming and wetting in the July 2021 Henan record-shattering rainfall", "paperId": "c487e00f989bb76151c9a9563aed25907c76a258"}, {"title": "On the Potentials and Limitations of Attributing a Small‐Scale Climate Event", "paperId": "bb0f961d509c2080a2d183ac63a9c4c189a270ac"}, {"title": "LATE REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL PROJECT 2022–2024", "paperId": "aa0ef13453031f92b2511ed4eacf7d58f1f6f617"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.5194/EGUSPHERE-EGU21-5731", "MAG": "3169673573", "PubMed": "34845022", "CorpusId": 236667892}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 4, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Environmental Science"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b13fd12e-cb86-4e7e-b73f-b6579fdd331a/download_file?safe_filename=Leach_et_al_2021_Forecast_based_attribution.pdf&file_format=pdf&type_of_work=Journal+article", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Leach2021Forecast-basedAO,\n author = {N.

Neural networks are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting when data distributions are non-stationary during continual online learning; learning of a later task often leads to forgetting of an earlier task. One solution approach is model-agnostic continual meta-learning, whereby both task-speciﬁc and meta parameters are trained. Here, we depart from this view and introduce a novel neural-network architecture inspired by neuromodulation in biological nervous systems. Neuromodulation is the biological mechanism that dynamically controls and ﬁne-tunes synaptic dynamics to complement the behavioral context in real-time, which has received limited attention in machine learning. We introduce a single-hidden-layer network that learns only a relatively small context vector per task (task-speciﬁc parameters) that neuromodulates unchanging, randomized weights (meta parameters) that transform the input. We show that when task boundaries are available, this approach can eliminate catastrophic forgetting entirely while also drastically reducing the number of learnable parameters relative to other context-vector-based approaches. Furthermore, by combining this model with a simple meta-learning approach for inferring task identity, we demonstrate that the model can be generalized into a framework to perform continual learning without knowledge of task boundaries. Finally, we showcase the framework in a supervised continual online learning scenario and discuss the implications of the proposed formalism.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.48550/arXiv.2204.04297", "DBLP": "journals/corr/abs-2204-04297", "ArXiv": "2204.04297", "CorpusId": 248085183}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@[''JournalArticle'']{Hong2022LearningTM,\n author = {Jinyung Hong and Theodore P.

This paper aims to address this limitation by introducing a new approach to learn binary embeddings from scratch, preserving the semantic relationships between words as well as the arithmetic properties of the embeddings themselves. To achieve this, we propose a novel genetic algorithm to learn the relationships between words from existing word analogy data-sets, carefully making sure that the arithmetic properties of the relationships are preserved.

We aim to address the long-range dependencies in clinical free text caused by different sections with the latest Transformer-XL model by fine-tuning it on MIMIC-III clinical text. Having requested and cleaned the MIMIC-III clinical text based on self-developed rules, we prepared the data for training classifiers on diagnostic code prediction of 8 common cardiovascular diseases. We used huggingface API to fine-tune and evaluate Transformer-XL model on MIMIC-III dataset and compared the results with baseline methods including bag-of-words and TF-IDF. And the Transformer-XL outperformed the Bag-of-Words and TFIDF on 3 of 6 tasks, on which we have already got the results. Furthermore, the Transformer-XL was only fine-tuned for 1 epoch, and therefore we believe there is a promising potential for a better fine-tuned Transformer-XL to better predict the diagnostic codes accurately. The better accuracy of diagnostic codes aids in the structuring of free-text clinical notes, which can be better and easier for downstream machine learning tasks, such as survival predictions and multi-modality data fusion, because, the structured diagnostic codes can be fed into machine learning models than the unstructured data. 1 Key Information to include • External collaborators (if you have any): NA • External mentor (if you have any): Olivier Gevaert • Sharing project: NA", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 235344288}, "isOpenAccess": false, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "openAccessPdf": null, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Zhan2021Fine-TuningTO,\n author = {X.

We find two VPNs encoding different visual features that target the same giant fiber dendrite establish their territories on the dendrite, in part, through sequential axon arrival during development prior to synaptogenesis. Physical occupancy is important to maintain territories, as we find the ablation of one VPN results in expanded dendrite territory of the remaining VPN, and that this compensation enables the GF to remain responsive to ethologically relevant visual stimuli.

We find significant differences in connection probabilities both across the entire left and right networks and between specific cell types. By rescaling connection probabilities or removing certain edges based on weight, we also present adjusted definitions of bilateral symmetry exhibited by this connectome.

In combinatorial coding, odorants are encoded by activation of multiple, broadly tuned olfactory sensory neurons that innervate distinct sets of glomeruli. In specialized olfactory pathways, information regarding a single or a few odorants is processed in a discrete, narrowly tuned circuit within a dedicated glomerulus. Here, we compared the narrowly tuned glomerulus DA2 with the broadly tuned glomerulus DL5 at the ultrastructural level, by using volume based focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. We provide a detailed analysis of neuronal innervation, synaptic composition as well as a circuit diagram of the major glomerular cell types: olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) and multiglomerular neurons (MGNs). By comparing our data with a previously mapped narrowly tuned glomerulus (VA1v), we disclose putative generic features of narrowly tuned glomerular circuits: a high density of neuronal fibers and synapses, a low degree of sensory lateralization, strong axo-axonic connections between OSNs as well as dendro-dendritic connections between uPNs, and a low degree of presynaptic inhibition at the OSN axons. We also show a unique property of the large uPN dendrite in DL5, which forms substantial amount of autapses.", "citations": [], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.09.30.510181", "CorpusId": 252716718}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 0, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/10/02/2022.09.30.510181.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Gruber2022DiversificationON,\n author = {Lydia Gruber and R.

These techniques have previously been used to match individual neurons in nanoscale connectomes – in particular, to find pairings of neurons across hemispheres. However, since graph matching techniques deal specifically with two isolated networks, they have only utilized the ipsilateral (same hemisphere) subgraphs when performing the matching. Here, we present a modification to a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm which allows it to solve what we call the bisected graph matching problem. This modification allows us to also use connections between the brain hemispheres when predicting neuron pairs. Via simulations and real connectome datasets we show that when edge correlation is present between the contralateral (between hemisphere) subgraphs, this approach improves matching accuracy. We expect that our proposed method will improve future endeavors to accurately match neurons across hemispheres in connectomes, and be useful in other applications where the bisected graph matching problem arises.", "citations": [{"title": "Generative network modeling reveals quantitative definitions of bilateral symmetry exhibited by a whole insect brain connectome", "paperId": "f2d84761d99eab3d143c0ac17842c48c6a959d99"}, {"title": "The connectome of an insect brain", "paperId": "0910cb7d82c4b4f0212b06ea14e1fe5637970289"}], "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1101/2022.05.19.492713", "CorpusId": 248990416}, "isOpenAccess": true, "citationCount": 2, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology"], "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/09/01/2022.05.19.492713.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@None{Pedigo2022BisectedGM,\n author = {B.
