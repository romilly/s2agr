        "title": "Combining Repetition Suppression and Pattern Analysis Provides New
        Insights into the Role of M1 and Parietal Areas in Skilled Sequential Actions",
        "abstract": "How does the brain change during learning? In functional magnetic
        resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, both multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)
        and repetition suppression (RS) have been used to detect changes in neuronal
        representations. In the context of motor sequence learning, the two techniques
        have provided discrepant findings: pattern analysis showed that only premotor
        and parietal regions, but not primary motor cortex (M1), develop a representation
        of trained sequences. In contrast, RS suggested trained sequence representations
        in all these regions. Here, we applied both analysis techniques to a five-week
        finger sequence training study, in which participants executed each sequence
        twice before switching to a different sequence. Both RS and pattern analysis
        indicated learning-related changes for parietal areas, but only RS showed
        a difference between trained and untrained sequences in M1. A more fine-grained
        analysis, however, revealed that the RS effect in M1 reflects a fundamentally
        different process than in parietal areas. On the first execution, M1 represents
        especially the first finger of each sequence, likely reflecting preparatory
        processes. This effect dramatically reduces during the second execution. In
        contrast, parietal areas represent the identity of a sequence, and this representation
        stays relatively stable on the second execution. These results suggest that
        the RS effect does not reflect a trained sequence representation in M1, but
        rather a preparatory signal for movement initiation. More generally, our study
        demonstrates that across regions RS can reflect different representational
        changes in the neuronal population code, emphasizing the importance of combining
        pattern analysis and RS techniques. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previous studies
        using pattern analysis have suggested that primary motor cortex (M1) does
        not represent learnt sequential actions. However, a study using repetition
        suppression (RS) has reported M1 changes during motor sequence learning. Combining
        both techniques, we first replicate the discrepancy between them, with learning-related
        changes in M1 in RS, but not pattern dissimilarities. We further analyzed
        the representational changes with repetition, and found that the RS effects
        differ across regions. M1''s activity represents the starting finger of the
        sequence, an effect that vanishes with repetition. In contrast, activity patterns
        in parietal areas exhibit sequence dependency, which persists with repetition.
        These results demonstrate the importance of combining RS and pattern analysis
        to understand the function of brain regions.", "venue": "Journal of Neuroscience",

        "title": "Comparing representational geometries using whitened unbiased-distance-matrix
        similarity", "abstract": "Representational similarity analysis (RSA) tests
        models of brain computation by investigating how neural activity patterns
        reflect experimental conditions. Instead of predicting activity patterns directly,
        the models predict the geometry of the representation, as defined by the representational
        dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which captures to what extent experimental conditions
        are associated with similar or dissimilar activity patterns. RSA therefore
        first quantifies the representational geometry by calculating a dissimilarity
        measure for each pair of conditions, and then compares the estimated representational
        dissimilarities to those predicted by each model. Here we address two central
        challenges of RSA: First, dissimilarity measures such as the Euclidean, Mahalanobis,
        and correlation distance, are biased by measurement noise, which can lead
        to incorrect inferences. Unbiased dissimilarity estimates can be obtained
        by crossvalidation, at the price of increased variance. Second, the pairwise
        dissimilarity estimates are not statistically independent, and ignoring this
        dependency makes model comparison statistically suboptimal. We present an
        analytical expression for the mean and (co)variance of both biased and unbiased
        estimators of the squared Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance, allowing us
        to quantify the bias-variance trade-off. We also use the analytical expression
        of the covariance of the dissimilarity estimates to whiten the RDM estimation
        errors. This results in a new criterion for RDM similarity, the whitened unbiased
        RDM cosine similarity (WUC), which allows for near-optimal model selection
        combined with robustness to correlated measurement noise.", "venue": "Neurons,

        conflicting fMRI evidence from repetition suppression and pattern analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract How does the brain change during learning? Functional
        magnetic resonance imaging studies have used both pattern analysis and repetition
        suppression (RS) to detect changes in neuronal representations. In the context
        of motor sequence learning, the two techniques have provided discrepant findings.
        Specifically, pattern analysis showed that only premotor and parietal regions,
        but not primary motor cortex (M1), develop a representation of trained sequences.
        In contrast, RS suggested trained sequence representations in all these regions.
        Here we applied both analysis techniques to data from a 5-week finger sequence
        training study, in which participants executed each sequence twice before
        switching to a different sequence. While we replicated both previously reported
        findings in the same paradigm, a more fine-grained analysis revealed that
        the RS effect in M1 and parietal areas reflect fundamentally different processes.
        On the first execution, M1 represents especially the first finger of each
        sequence, which might reflect preparatory processes, and this effect dramatically
        reduces during the second execution. In contrast, parietal areas represent
        the identity of a sequence, and this representation stays relatively stable
        on the second execution, only reducing proportionally to the reduction in
        overall activity. These results suggest that the RS effect in M1 does not
        reflect trained sequence representation, but rather the altered communication
        with higher-order areas. More generally, our study demonstrates that RS can
        reflect different representational changes in the underlying neuronal population
        code across regions, emphasizing the importance of combining pattern analysis
        and RS techniques.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 56, "citationCount":

        correlation", "abstract": "Representational similarity analysis (RSA) tests
        models of brain computation by investigating how neural activity patterns
        change in response to different experimental conditions. Instead of predicting
        activity patterns directly, the models predict the geometry of the representation,
        i.e. to what extent experimental conditions are associated with similar or
        dissimilar activity patterns. RSA therefore first quantifies the representational
        geometry by calculating a dissimilarity measure for all pairs of conditions,
        and then compares the estimated representational dissimilarities to those
        predicted by the model. Here we address two central challenges of RSA: First,
        dissimilarity measures such as the Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and correlation
        distance, are biased by measurement noise, which can lead to incorrect inferences.
        Unbiased dissimilarity estimates can be obtained by crossvalidation, at the
        price of increased variance. Second, the pairwise dissimilarity estimates
        are not statistically independent. Ignoring the dependency makes model comparison
        with RSA statistically suboptimal. We present an analytical expression for
        the mean and (co-)variance of both biased and unbiased estimators of Euclidean
        and Mahalanobis distance, allowing us to exactly quantify the bias-variance
        trade-off. We then use the analytical expression of the co-variance of the
        dissimilarity estimates to derive a simple method correcting for this covariance.
        Combining unbiased distance estimates with this correction leads to a novel
        criterion for comparing representational geometries, the unbiased distance
        correlation, which, as we show, allows for near optimal model comparison.",

        reinvestigate proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) correlates
        of motor learning in a preregistered longitudinal study with four scanning
        sessions over 5 weeks of training. Activation decreased more for trained than
        untrained sequences in premotor and parietal areas, without any evidence of
        learning-related activation increases. Premotor and parietal regions also
        exhibited changes in the fine-grained, sequence-specific activation patterns
        early in learning, which stabilized later. No changes were observed in the
        primary motor cortex (M1). Overall, our study provides evidence that human
        motor sequence learning occurs outside of M1. Furthermore, it shows that we
        cannot expect to find activity increases as an indicator for learning, making
        subtle changes in activity patterns across weeks the most promising fMRI correlate

        "abstract": "How does the brain change during skill learning? We previously
        conducted a longitudinal fMRI motor sequence learning study and, using multivariate
        techniques, found learning-related changes in premotor and parietal areas,
        but not in the primary motor cortex (M1) (1). However, a study using repetition
        suppression (RS) had previously suggested that M1 represents learned sequences.
        Here we replicate this discrepancy in a single experiment, allowing us to
        investigate the differences between RS and multivariate pattern analysis in
        detail. We found that the RS effect in M1 and parietal areas reflect fundamentally
        different processes. M1\u2019s activity represents the starting finger of
        the sequence, an effect that vanishes with repetition. In contrast, activity
        patterns in parietal areas exhibit sequence dependency, which persists with
        repetition. These findings demonstrate that combining RS and pattern analysis
        can provide novel functional insights, here specifically into the relative
        contribution of cortical motor areas to sequence production.", "venue": "bioRxiv",

        "abstract": "Despite numerous studies, there is little agreement about what
        brain changes accompany motor sequence learning, partly because of a general
        publication bias that favors novel results. We therefore decided to systematically
        reinvestigate proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates of
        motor learning in a preregistered longitudinal study with four scanning sessions
        over 5 weeks of training. Activation decreased more for trained than untrained
        sequences in premotor and parietal areas, without any evidence of learning-related
        activation increases. Premotor and parietal regions also exhibited changes
        in the fine-grained, sequence-specific activation patterns early in learning,
        which stabilized later. No changes were observed in the primary motor cortex
        (M1). Overall, our study provides evidence that human motor sequence learning
        occurs outside of M1. Furthermore, it shows that we cannot expect to find
        activity increases as an indicator for learning, making subtle changes in
        activity patterns across weeks the most promising fMRI correlate of training-induced
        plasticity.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 124, "citationCount":

        "title": "Ipsilateral finger representations in the sensorimotor cortex are
        driven by active movement processes, not passive sensory input.", "abstract":
        "Hand and finger movements are mostly controlled through crossed corticospinal
        projections from the contralateral hemisphere. During unimanual movements,
        activity in the contralateral hemisphere is increased while the ipsilateral
        hemisphere is suppressed below resting baseline. Despite this suppression,
        unimanual movements can be decoded from ipsilateral activity alone. This indicates
        that ipsilateral activity patterns represent parameters of ongoing movement,
        but the origin and functional relevance of these representations is unclear.
        In this study, we asked whether ipsilateral representations are caused by
        active movement or whether they are driven by sensory input. Participants
        alternated between performing single finger presses and having fingers passively
        stimulated while we recorded brain activity using high-field (7T) functional
        imaging. We contrasted active and passive finger representations in sensorimotor
        areas of ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Finger representations
        in the contralateral hemisphere were equally strong under passive and active
        conditions, highlighting the importance of sensory information in feedback
        control. In contrast, ipsilateral finger representations in the sensorimotor
        cortex were stronger during active presses. Furthermore, the spatial distribution
        of finger representations differed between hemispheres: the contralateral
        hemisphere showed the strongest finger representations in Brodmann areas 3a
        and 3b, whereas the ipsilateral hemisphere exhibited stronger representations
        in premotor and parietal areas. Altogether, our results suggest that finger
        representations in the two hemispheres have different origins: contralateral
        representations are driven by both active movement and sensory stimulation,
        whereas ipsilateral representations are mainly engaged during active movement.
        NEW & NOTEWORTHY Movements of the human body are mostly controlled by contralateral
        cortical regions. The function of ipsilateral activity during movements remains
        elusive. Using high-field neuroimaging, we investigated how human contralateral
        and ipsilateral hemispheres represent active and passive finger presses. We
        found that representations in contralateral sensorimotor cortex are equally
        strong during both conditions. Ipsilateral representations were mostly present
        during active movement, suggesting that sensorimotor areas do not receive
        direct sensory input from the ipsilateral hand.", "venue": "Journal of Neurophysiology",

        but not sensory processing", "abstract": "Hand and finger movements are mostly
        controlled through crossed corticospinal projections from the contralateral
        hemisphere. During unimanual movements, activity in the contralateral hemisphere
        is increased while the ipsilateral hemisphere is suppressed below resting
        baseline. Despite this suppression, unimanual movements can be decoded from
        ipsilateral activity alone. This indicates that ipsilateral activity patterns
        represent parameters of ongoing movement, but the origin and functional relevance
        of these representations is unclear. Here, we asked whether human ipsilateral
        representations are caused by active movement, or whether they are driven
        by sensory input. Participants alternated between performing single finger
        presses and having fingers passively stimulated, while we recorded brain activity
        using high-field (7T) functional imaging. We contrasted active and passive
        finger representations in sensorimotor areas of ipsilateral and contralateral
        hemispheres. Finger representations in the contralateral hemisphere were equally
        strong under passive and active conditions, highlighting the importance of
        sensory information in feedback control. In contrast, ipsilateral finger representations
        were stronger during active presses. Furthermore, the spatial distribution
        of finger representations differed between hemispheres: the contralateral
        hemisphere showed the strongest finger representations in Brodmann area 3a
        and 3b, while the ipsilateral hemisphere exhibited stronger representations
        in premotor and parietal areas. This suggests that finger representations
        in the two hemispheres have different origins \u2013 contralateral representations
        are driven by both active movement and sensory stimulation, whereas ipsilateral
        representations are mainly engaged during active movement. This suggests that
        a possible contribution of the ipsilateral hemisphere lies in movement planning,
        rather than in the dexterous feedback control of the movement. Significance
        statement Movements of the human body are mostly controlled by contralateral
        cortical regions. However, activity in ipsilateral sensorimotor regions is
        also modulated during active movements. The origin and functional relevance
        of these ipsilateral representations is unclear. Here we used high-field neuroimaging
        to investigate how human contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres represent
        active finger presses and passive finger stimulation. We report that while
        the contralateral hemisphere was equally strongly recruited during active
        and passive conditions, the ipsilateral hemisphere was mostly recruited during
        active movement. We propose that the ipsilateral hemisphere may play a role
        in bilateral movement planning.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

        Cortex at High Spatial Resolution", "abstract": "Auditory inputs reaching
        our ears are often incomplete, but our brains nevertheless transform them
        into rich and complete perceptual phenomena such as meaningful conversations
        or pleasurable music. It has been hypothesized that our brains extract regularities
        in inputs, which enables us to predict the upcoming stimuli, leading to efficient
        sensory processing. However, it is unclear whether tone predictions are encoded
        with similar specificity as perceived signals. Here, we used high-field fMRI
        to investigate whether human auditory regions encode one of the most defining
        characteristics of auditory perception: the frequency of predicted tones.
        Two pairs of tone sequences were presented in ascending or descending directions,
        with the last tone omitted in half of the trials. Every pair of incomplete
        sequences contained identical sounds, but was associated with different expectations
        about the last tone (a high- or low-frequency target). This allowed us to
        disambiguate predictive signaling from sensory-driven processing. We recorded
        fMRI responses from eight female participants during passive listening to
        complete and incomplete sequences. Inspection of specificity and spatial patterns
        of responses revealed that target frequencies were encoded similarly during
        their presentations, as well as during omissions, suggesting frequency-specific
        encoding of predicted tones in the auditory cortex (AC). Importantly, frequency
        specificity of predictive signaling was observed already at the earliest levels
        of auditory cortical hierarchy: in the primary AC. Our findings provide evidence
        for content-specific predictive processing starting at the earliest cortical
        levels. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Given the abundance of sensory information
        around us in any given moment, it has been proposed that our brain uses contextual
        information to prioritize and form predictions about incoming signals. However,
        there remains a surprising lack of understanding of the specificity and content
        of such prediction signaling; for example, whether a predicted tone is encoded
        with similar specificity as a perceived tone. Here, we show that early auditory
        regions encode the frequency of a tone that is predicted yet omitted. Our
        findings contribute to the understanding of how expectations shape sound processing
        in the human auditory cortex and provide further insights into how contextual
        information influences computations in neuronal circuits.", "venue": "Journal

        "Perceiving the sensory consequences of action accurately is essential for
        appropriate interaction with our physical and social environments. Prediction
        mechanisms are considered necessary for fine-tuned sensory control of action,
        yet paradoxically may distort perception. Here, we examine this paradox by
        addressing how movement influences the perceived duration of sensory outcomes
        congruent with action. Experiment 1 required participants to make judgments
        about the duration of vibrations applied to a moving or stationary finger.
        In Experiments 2 and 3, participants judged observed finger movements that
        were congruent or incongruent with their own actions. In all experiments,
        target events were perceived to be longer when congruent with movement. Interestingly,
        this temporal dilation did not differ as a function of stimulus perspective
        (1st or 3rd person) or spatial location. We propose that this bias may reflect
        the operation of an adaptive mechanism for sensorimotor selection and control
        that preactivates anticipated outcomes of action. The bias itself may have
        surprising implications for both action control and perception of others:
        we may be in contact with grasped objects for less time than we realize, and
        others\u2019 reactions to us may be briefer than we believe.", "venue": "Journal

        body is used as a reference for perception of external objects. Using the
        rubber hand illusion, we manipulated participants\u2019 representation of
        their hand size. Illusion was induced in 32 participants using a small, medium-sized
        or large glove and participants then estimated ball diameters. Results indicated
        that glove size modulated diameter estimates: viewing a large glove resulted
        in underestimations of ball size, medium glove in accurate estimates, and
        a small glove in overestimations; however, estimates in small and medium glove
        condition did not di\"er signi!cantly. Results suggest that one\u2019s hand
        size is implicitly assimilated to the size of the glove and that this assimilation
        in turn in#uences subsequent size estimations. Further research is needed
        to determine whether or one\u2019s hand size can be assimilated to the small
        glove.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount":
