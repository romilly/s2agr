        Insights into the Role of M1 and Parietal Areas in Skilled Sequential Actions",
        "abstract": "How does the brain change during learning? In functional magnetic
        resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, both multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)
        and repetition suppression (RS) have been used to detect changes in neuronal
        representations. In the context of motor sequence learning, the two techniques
        have provided discrepant findings: pattern analysis showed that only premotor
        and parietal regions, but not primary motor cortex (M1), develop a representation
        of trained sequences. In contrast, RS suggested trained sequence representations
        in all these regions. Here, we applied both analysis techniques to a five-week
        finger sequence training study, in which participants executed each sequence
        twice before switching to a different sequence. Both RS and pattern analysis
        indicated learning-related changes for parietal areas, but only RS showed
        a difference between trained and untrained sequences in M1. A more fine-grained
        analysis, however, revealed that the RS effect in M1 reflects a fundamentally
        different process than in parietal areas. On the first execution, M1 represents
        especially the first finger of each sequence, likely reflecting preparatory
        processes. This effect dramatically reduces during the second execution. In
        contrast, parietal areas represent the identity of a sequence, and this representation
        stays relatively stable on the second execution. These results suggest that
        the RS effect does not reflect a trained sequence representation in M1, but
        rather a preparatory signal for movement initiation. More generally, our study
        demonstrates that across regions RS can reflect different representational
        changes in the neuronal population code, emphasizing the importance of combining
        pattern analysis and RS techniques. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previous studies
        using pattern analysis have suggested that primary motor cortex (M1) does
        not represent learnt sequential actions. However, a study using repetition
        suppression (RS) has reported M1 changes during motor sequence learning. Combining
        both techniques, we first replicate the discrepancy between them, with learning-related
        changes in M1 in RS, but not pattern dissimilarities. We further analyzed
        the representational changes with repetition, and found that the RS effects
        differ across regions. M1''s activity represents the starting finger of the
        sequence, an effect that vanishes with repetition. In contrast, activity patterns
        in parietal areas exhibit sequence dependency, which persists with repetition.
        These results demonstrate the importance of combining RS and pattern analysis
        to understand the function of brain regions.", "venue": "Journal of Neuroscience",

        different processes. M1\u2019s activity represents the starting finger of
        the sequence, an effect that vanishes with repetition. In contrast, activity
        patterns in parietal areas exhibit sequence dependency, which persists with
        repetition. These findings demonstrate that combining RS and pattern analysis

        driven by active movement processes, not passive sensory input.", "abstract":
        "Hand and finger movements are mostly controlled through crossed corticospinal
        projections from the contralateral hemisphere. During unimanual movements,
        activity in the contralateral hemisphere is increased while the ipsilateral
        hemisphere is suppressed below resting baseline. Despite this suppression,
        unimanual movements can be decoded from ipsilateral activity alone. This indicates
        that ipsilateral activity patterns represent parameters of ongoing movement,
        but the origin and functional relevance of these representations is unclear.
        In this study, we asked whether ipsilateral representations are caused by
        active movement or whether they are driven by sensory input. Participants
        alternated between performing single finger presses and having fingers passively
        stimulated while we recorded brain activity using high-field (7T) functional
        imaging. We contrasted active and passive finger representations in sensorimotor
        areas of ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Finger representations
        in the contralateral hemisphere were equally strong under passive and active
        conditions, highlighting the importance of sensory information in feedback
        control. In contrast, ipsilateral finger representations in the sensorimotor
        cortex were stronger during active presses. Furthermore, the spatial distribution
        of finger representations differed between hemispheres: the contralateral
        hemisphere showed the strongest finger representations in Brodmann areas 3a
        and 3b, whereas the ipsilateral hemisphere exhibited stronger representations
        in premotor and parietal areas. Altogether, our results suggest that finger
        representations in the two hemispheres have different origins: contralateral
        representations are driven by both active movement and sensory stimulation,
        whereas ipsilateral representations are mainly engaged during active movement.
        NEW & NOTEWORTHY Movements of the human body are mostly controlled by contralateral
        cortical regions. The function of ipsilateral activity during movements remains
        elusive. Using high-field neuroimaging, we investigated how human contralateral
        and ipsilateral hemispheres represent active and passive finger presses. We
        found that representations in contralateral sensorimotor cortex are equally
        strong during both conditions. Ipsilateral representations were mostly present
        during active movement, suggesting that sensorimotor areas do not receive

        suppression (RS) provides an important tool to investigate brain representations.
        Repetition of the same stimulus evokes a reduction in elicited brain activity.
        While the reduction in activity is consistently observed across modalities
        and species, it is unclear what mechanisms drive this effect. Several models
        of RS have been proposed, which vary in their prediction of stimulus \u2018tuning\u2019
        in the second repetition. Here we examined RS mechanisms in two motor cortical
        areas and the striatum while participants executed motoric finger sequences,
        twice in a row. We distinguished the RS models by investigating the changes
        in the sequence-dependent fMRI activity patterns in concert with the changes
        in overall activity. In the striatum, we observed that the tuning for individual
        sequences is \u2018sharpened\u2019 on the second execution, whereas in the
        cortex we found a \u2018fatigued\u2019 representation. This dissociation might
        indicate different computational roles along the cortico-striatal circuitry,

        Cortex at High Spatial Resolution", "abstract": "Auditory inputs reaching
        our ears are often incomplete, but our brains nevertheless transform them
        into rich and complete perceptual phenomena such as meaningful conversations
        or pleasurable music. It has been hypothesized that our brains extract regularities
        in inputs, which enables us to predict the upcoming stimuli, leading to efficient
        sensory processing. However, it is unclear whether tone predictions are encoded
        with similar specificity as perceived signals. Here, we used high-field fMRI
        to investigate whether human auditory regions encode one of the most defining
        characteristics of auditory perception: the frequency of predicted tones.
        Two pairs of tone sequences were presented in ascending or descending directions,
        with the last tone omitted in half of the trials. Every pair of incomplete
        sequences contained identical sounds, but was associated with different expectations
        about the last tone (a high- or low-frequency target). This allowed us to
        disambiguate predictive signaling from sensory-driven processing. We recorded
        fMRI responses from eight female participants during passive listening to
        complete and incomplete sequences. Inspection of specificity and spatial patterns
        of responses revealed that target frequencies were encoded similarly during
        their presentations, as well as during omissions, suggesting frequency-specific
        encoding of predicted tones in the auditory cortex (AC). Importantly, frequency
        specificity of predictive signaling was observed already at the earliest levels
        of auditory cortical hierarchy: in the primary AC. Our findings provide evidence
        for content-specific predictive processing starting at the earliest cortical
        levels. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Given the abundance of sensory information
        around us in any given moment, it has been proposed that our brain uses contextual
        information to prioritize and form predictions about incoming signals. However,
        there remains a surprising lack of understanding of the specificity and content
        of such prediction signaling; for example, whether a predicted tone is encoded
        with similar specificity as a perceived tone. Here, we show that early auditory
        regions encode the frequency of a tone that is predicted yet omitted. Our
        findings contribute to the understanding of how expectations shape sound processing
        in the human auditory cortex and provide further insights into how contextual
        information influences computations in neuronal circuits.", "venue": "Journal

        "Perceiving the sensory consequences of action accurately is essential for
        appropriate interaction with our physical and social environments. Prediction
        mechanisms are considered necessary for fine-tuned sensory control of action,
        yet paradoxically may distort perception. Here, we examine this paradox by
        addressing how movement influences the perceived duration of sensory outcomes
        congruent with action. Experiment 1 required participants to make judgments
        about the duration of vibrations applied to a moving or stationary finger.
        In Experiments 2 and 3, participants judged observed finger movements that
        were congruent or incongruent with their own actions. In all experiments,
        target events were perceived to be longer when congruent with movement. Interestingly,
        this temporal dilation did not differ as a function of stimulus perspective
        (1st or 3rd person) or spatial location. We propose that this bias may reflect
        the operation of an adaptive mechanism for sensorimotor selection and control
        that preactivates anticipated outcomes of action. The bias itself may have
        surprising implications for both action control and perception of others:
        we may be in contact with grasped objects for less time than we realize, and
        others\u2019 reactions to us may be briefer than we believe.", "venue": "Journal

        body is used as a reference for perception of external objects. Using the
        rubber hand illusion, we manipulated participants\u2019 representation of
        their hand size. Illusion was induced in 32 participants using a small, medium-sized
        or large glove and participants then estimated ball diameters. Results indicated
        that glove size modulated diameter estimates: viewing a large glove resulted
        in underestimations of ball size, medium glove in accurate estimates, and
        a small glove in overestimations; however, estimates in small and medium glove
        condition did not di\"er signi!cantly. Results suggest that one\u2019s hand
        size is implicitly assimilated to the size of the glove and that this assimilation
        in turn in#uences subsequent size estimations. Further research is needed
        to determine whether or one\u2019s hand size can be assimilated to the small
        glove.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount":
