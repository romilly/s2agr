        of the Literature Graph in Semantic Scholar", "abstract": "We describe a deployed
        scalable system for organizing published scientific literature into a heterogeneous
        graph to facilitate algorithmic manipulation and discovery. The resulting
        literature graph consists of more than 280M nodes, representing papers, authors,
        entities and various interactions between them (e.g., authorships, citations,
        entity mentions). We reduce literature graph construction into familiar NLP
        tasks (e.g., entity extraction and linking), point out research challenges
        due to differences from standard formulations of these tasks, and report empirical
        results for each task. The methods described in this paper are used to enable
        semantic features in www.semanticscholar.org."}
