    "abstract": "In view of the single stereotype of memorizing knowledge points with the help of traditional books and easy to distract attention in the process of memorizing with the help of mobile phones and computers, a mobile handheld device, memory assistant, is designed and developed based on Ebbinghaus forgetting law curve, embedded software and hardware development technology, and memory list cycle pushing intelligent algorithm designed by forgetting curve law as the core. The experiment shows that the device is convenient and flexible like electronic devices such as mobile phones and computers, and also has the characteristics of high efficiency and concentration of book memorizing, at the same time, scientific and reasonable learning plan can effectively improve the efficiency of users\u2019 Recitation and memory.",
