**Abstract:** The dominant view in [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) is that changes in [synaptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse) [weights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training) underlie [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning). It is unclear, however, how the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) is able to determine which [synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse) should [change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change), and by how much. This [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty) stands in [sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Corporation) [contrast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_ratio) to [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), where changes in [weights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function) are explicitly [engineered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) to [optimize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) [performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_performance). However, the main [tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_tool) for that, [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation), has two problems. One is [neuro-science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) related: it is not biologically plausible. The other is inherent: networks [trained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training) with this rule tend to forget [old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age) tasks when learning new ones. Here we introduce the [Dendritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) [Gated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand-gated_ion_channel) Network ([DGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGN)), a variant of the Gated [Linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity) [Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network), which offers a [biologically plausible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_plausibility) alternative to [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). DGNs combine [dendritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) ‘gating’ (whereby [interneurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneuron) target [dendrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) to [shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape) [neuronal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) responses) with local [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education) rules to yield provably [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency) [performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance). They are significantly more [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency) than conventional [artificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), and are highly [resistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance) to forgetting. Consequently, they perform well on a variety of tasks, in some cases better than [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). Importantly, DGNs have [structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) and [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) similarities to the [cerebellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum), a link that we strengthen by using [in vivo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo) [two-photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_excitation_microscopy) [calcium imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_imaging) [to show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_T.O._Show) that single [interneurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneuron) [suppress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression) [activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise) in individual dendritic branches of [Purkinje cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_cell), a key feature of the model. Thus, DGNs [leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(TV_series)) targeted [dendritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) [inhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor) and [local](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic) [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning) – two [features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) [ubiquitous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing) in the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) – to achieve fast and [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency) [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning)
