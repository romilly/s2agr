During [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning), the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) modifies [synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse) to improve [behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior). In the [cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex), [synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse) are [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) within multilayered [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), making it difficult to determine the effect of an individual [synaptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse) modification on the behaviour of the [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer). The [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) solves this problem in deep [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)[neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), but [historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History) it has been viewed as [biologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology) [problematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problematic_(album)). Nonetheless, [recent developments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain) in [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) and the successes of [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)[neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neural_network) have reinvigorated [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention) in whether [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) offers [insights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight) for [understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding) [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning) in the [cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex). The [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) learns quickly by [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) [synaptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse) updates using [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback) [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex) to deliver [error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedometer) [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electrical_engineering)). Although [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback) [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex) are [ubiquitous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing) in the [cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex), it is difficult to see how they could [deliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth) the [error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) signals required by strict formulations of [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). Here [we](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_(novel)) build on [past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_tense) and recent developments to [argue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument) that [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback) [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex) may instead induce neural activities whose differences can be used to locally [approximate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation) these signals and hence drive effective [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning) in deep [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) in the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain). The [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) of [error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) (backprop) [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) is frequently used to train [deep neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), but it has not been viewed as being implemented by the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain). In this [Perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy)), however, [Lillicrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Lillicrap) and colleagues [argue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument) that the key [principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle) underlying [backprop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) [may](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2005_in_science) indeed have a role in [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain)[brain function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain)
