# Semantic Scholar Academic Graph Researcher

This is an independently developed Python application to enable access to, and local caching of,
the [Semantic Scholar Academic Graph](https://www.semanticscholar.org/me/research) from AIAI.

It uses the new [S2AG API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/graph).

It can now create a page for paper in logseq format.

The application has lots of functionality but no documentation, so not yet ready for production.

I am sharing the code following the principles in Austin Kleon's excellent book
[Show Your Work](https://amazon.co.uk/Show-Your-Work-Getting-Discovered/dp/076117897X/),
and because I will refer to the code in a couple of planned blog posts.
